<P>Welcome to yet another tutorial. Ok the quote:</P>

<P>Part 1 &ndash; Collisions<BR>Part 2 &ndash; Rendering Text<BR>Part
3 &ndash; Multi pass rendering<BR>Part 4 &ndash; Multi texturing</P>
<P>This tutorial seems quite BIG :) Maybe it should have been 4
tutorials? O well lets rumble:</P>
<H1>Part 1 &ndash; Collisions</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>More
physics</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Yes we continue with the physics thing. Starting with everything
done in the previous tutorial as a basis.</P>
<P>The first thing is to find out if things collided or not:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Collision
detection</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The 100% complete solution to collision detection would be to test
every primitive in object A with every primitive in object B. A
primitive would usually be a triangle in 3D space. This solution
would render a 100% correct answer... BUT it would take ages to
compute!</P>
<P>The best way to detect collisions is determined by the situation.
Usually the answer comes down to some complex 3D geometry problem.
Testing static collision detection is usually not that hard. Things
become a lot more complex when testing between moving objects.</P>
<P>One way to solve the moving problem is to divide the time segment
into a number of smaller segments and do static collision detection
on each of these small time segments. But this method is also limited
and also make for a lot more calculations which may slow things down.
But none the less a method to keep in the back of your head.</P>
<P>If 3D geometry scares you, you can either try to overcome that
fear by making some effort into studying it. (I did a few courses at
university with this stuff which makes things a little bit easier) Or
you can try to avoid it by simply taking the results of other peoples
work. In which case you simply want to quickly scan through this
section of the tutorial.</P>
<P>3D geometry uses to things heavily: The dot product and the cross
product.<BR>I'm not going to give you a complete 3D geometry class in
these tutorials. That a subject for you own research!<BR>But in basic
<B>dot product</B> is:<BR>If there is 2 vectors A and B. Then A dot B
gives a scaler of the size size(A)*size(B)*sin(Theta). Where Theta is
the angle between the 2 vectors.<BR>size(A) can computed as
sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z) where x,y and z is the components of the vector.<BR>A
dot B = A.x*B.x + A.y*B.y + A.z+B.z <BR>Its easy and its fast. The
main reason we use this is because of the sinus term in the answer.
If the answer is positive the angle between the 2 vectors is less
than 90 degrees and if the answer is negative the angle is more the
90 degrees. ect. <BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>A <B>cross product</B> is more complex:<BR>Once again between to
vectors A and B. The answer is this time another vector we will call
C.<BR>the size of C equals size(A)*size(B)*cos(Theta) <BR>But
remember C is a vector! The direction of C is tangent to both A and B
and the direction is determined according to the ordering of A and B.
<BR>If A and B is both flat on your desk. Now Theta is determined
from A to B. So you put your right hand down in a thumbs up way. Then
your fingers show the direction from A to B. And you thumb points in
the direction of C.<BR>I should probably make a diagram for this.</P>
<P>C = A cross B is computed as follows:<BR>C.x = A.y*B.z &ndash;
A.z*B.y<BR>C.y = A.z*B.x &ndash; A.x*B.z<BR>C.z = A.x*B.y &ndash;
A.y*B.x<BR>Quite intimidating at first. But don't worry this is
simply a function to use.<BR>The main advantage of this function is
that C is perpendicular to both A and B.</P>
<P>To <B>Normalize</B> a vector we divide it by it's size. The reason
for wanting to do this is that the size of a normalized vector is 1.
Thus removing the size vectors from the answers from the dot and
cross products. The problem is that we need to compute a square-root
to do this which is a expensive operation. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Ok
lets look at Collision detection</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Lets look at a very simple example. 2 Spheres.<BR>Calculating the
distance between the 2 center points of the spheres is very simple.
And when this distance is smaller or equal than the sum of the
radius's of both spheres we have a collision. Now the most simple
solution would be to check this every frame. But this will only work
if the spheres move relatively slowly.</P>
<P>The second solution we might determine is to cut op every frame
into a number of segments and check collision for every segment. The
number of segments may be determined by the speed of the spheres. But
this will only work if the spheres move at moderate speeds. Which in
most cases will be good enough. But this will result in a little bit
of inaccuracy. 
</P>
<P>The main problem is that to accurately determine the result of the
collision we need to now the exact locations (ie. time) of the
spheres when colliding. To solve this problem we need a new
algorithm:<BR>Starting with the distance between the spheres as A-B
where A and B is the positions of the spheres. We are looking for
when A-B = (sum of sizes) <BR>But now we add time (t) to the
equation. Now A.x = xpos + t*xvelocity (same for y and z and also for
B)<BR>Lets work only in 1 dimension for now. (It's easy to add the
other dimensions later)<BR>A.x-B.x becomes (A.xpos-B.xpos) +
t*(A.xvelocity &ndash; B.xvelocity) = deltaxpos + t*deltaxvel =
xdiff<BR>now in 3 dimensions we need to calculate xdiff^2 + ydiff^2 +
zdiff^2 = (sum of sizes)^2<BR>So xdiff^2 = deltaxpos^2 +
t*2*deltaxvel*deltaxpos + (deltaxvel^2)*(t^2) <BR>And then we can add
up all the terms resulting in a quadratic equation of the form a(t^2)
+ bt + c = 0.<BR>(note that if a=0 then also would b=0 and the
spheres are standing still: no collision)<BR>remember c = deltapos^2
&ndash; xdiff^2 to get a 0 at the other side of the equation.<BR>This
type of equation we solve somewhere in high school :) <BR>First
calculate Delta = b^2 &ndash; 4ac (if delta is negative no answer
exist)<BR>Then t = (-b (+or-) sqrt(Delta))/2a resulting in 2
answers!<BR>We want the first answer. Because the second answer would
be the time after they passed through each other. (not interested)<BR>So
we calculate t1 = (-b + sqrt(delta))/2a and t2 = (-b &ndash;
sqrt(delta))/2a and take the smaller one.</P>
<P>As easy as that! <BR>Btw this technique is called local
linearization because we linearize the motion and throw away
acceleration. :)<BR>The example is in <U>coll1.cpp</U> check out the
<B>CheckCollision</B> function.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Collision handling</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>When 2 objects collide we have some energy that is involved here.
Energy has to go somewhere:<BR>-Heat, explosion ect.<BR>-Deforming
the object... even breaking it.<BR>-Altering the velocity of the
object result in it to bounce away or coming to standstill</P>
<P>Now firstly we must construct a normal vector in the direction of
the other sphere. Only forces in this direction will be altered in
the collision. Everything else will go on as normal for now. This is
only true if there is no friction, and a good approximation for 2
spheres colliding.</P>
<P>We get a direction vector by simply subtracting the positions from
each other and normalizing the vector.<BR>Now if we multiply the
velocity components with this vector we get a new velocity vector
that is the velocity that is perpendicular to the collision. This
means we have effectively made the whole thing 1 dimensional, well
sort off :) There is still 3 components to the vector. 
</P>
<P>I found this amazing sight on physics by Martin Baker
(<A HREF="http://www.euclideanspace.com/">www.euclideanspace.com</A>)
If you want to know anything about physics and the formulas for
gaming purposes go there. Thanks Martin.</P>
<P>Since we simplified our problem to a 1 dimensional problem we can
use the 1D solution to calculate the new velocities of the objects.</P>
<P>The formula given is :</P>
<P>Avelfinal =
Avel*(Amass-e*Bmass)/(Amass+Bmass)+Bvel*(e+1)*(Bmass)/(Amass+Bmass)</P>
<P>e is the <B>elastistisity factor</B> from 0 to 1. And depends on
the material of the object.</P>
<P>Step 1- calculate the normal between the objects.<BR>Step 2-
calculate the perpendicular velocity's and remove it from the
object.<BR>Step 3- calculate the new perpendicular velocity's and add
them to the object.</P>
<P>Check the function <B>HandleCollision</B> in <U>coll1.cpp</U>.</P>
<P>Since collisions happens only a very small fraction of the times
we check for collisions we can safely get away with much more complex
collision handling things that are more expensive in processing
power. The place to optimize is in collision detection. In collision
handling we want to make out application more realistic that is the
main aim.</P>
<P>The above method for collision handling is very simple. We will
later look at more complex ways to do these things. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Enough
about collisions (for now)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok thats it for physics and collisions now. But this will be an
ongoing theme through my tutorials. If that really bugs you, you can
skip those sections :)</P>
<P>Next time we will look at simple structural physics. (no nothing
big) I think a simple rope will be a good start.</P>
<P>Please note that there can never be one complete tutorial on
collisions since it is up to you to find the best solution for the
problem at hand. But you can learn a lot at seeing and reading.</P>
<H1>Part 2 &ndash; Rendering text</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Hello</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok rendering text seems more a problem than you would think. <BR>But
don't worry nothing is impossible!</P>
<P>Firstly I like to quickly tell you something different: text is
2D... for the moment :)<BR>Anyways this means that a 3D world and a
3D viewing camera setup with <B>gluPerspective</B> might not be
always as nice. especially if you want text somewhere specific on the
screen.<BR>So we rather use <B>gluOrtho2D</B> to setup the camera
this time this gives us a nice flat viewing region where the z
coordinate gets ignored. So now we can use <B>glVertex2</B> functions
and only specify x and y coordinates.</P>
<P><B>gluOrtho2D(left,right,bottom,top)</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Freetype
library</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I decided to use the freetype library to produce the text we want
to get rendered. The reasons:<BR>Its free always a bonus.<BR>It works
with true-type fonts. Which is what we want.<BR>It does anti-aliasing
which is kewl.</P>
<P>Go look at the example in <U>ttf1.cpp</U>. It displays some text
on the screen. Very basic.</P>
<P>I've created a <B>Textclass</B> to handle the text for us. You
will need a separate <B>Textclass</B> object for every font.</P>
<P>Ok the basic strategy is:<BR>Create one BIG texture and put all
the characters on it. Then get some functions working to select only
the portion of the texture we want. ie. the portion with the wanted
character.</P>
<P>Now go look in the <B>Load</B> function:<BR>Firstly we initialize
the freetype library with <B>FT_Init_FreeType</B>.<BR>Then we load
the font with <B>FT_New_Face</B>. Freetype has some really wacky
terminology :)<BR>Set the pixel size with <B>FT_Set_Pixel_Size</B>.<BR>Now
we determine the texture size we need. This is done from the
pixelsize selected. This is a non-optimal method but will have to do
for now.<BR>We create a bitmap for the image. 2 components per pixel:
luminance and alpha.<BR>We create an array to hold the coordinates
for the characters.</P>
<P>Now then next step is to load each character and copy it to the
bitmap. But this is a little more tricky than it would sound. The
first reason for this being that the letters have variable sizes
apart from the fact that some don't exist. In fact some will create
bitmaps that has more than 16 rows! This is because of the
anti-aliasing.</P>
<P>Anyways the solution is quite simple: Stack them into the texture
as they arrive. This is what the x and y variables do. ymax simply
keeps track of the rows maximum height so that the next row will be
below that. This method packs all the characters nicely in the
texture while leaving nice 2 pixel boundaries between them and yet
leaving almost 50% of the texture unused. We also calculate the
texture coordinates needed for every character.</P>
<P>All that remains is to pass this bitmap to opengl to make a
texture from it. <BR>And clean-up a bit.</P>
<P>The first simple render function is <B>PutChar</B>. Everything
inside is pretty straightforward. It loads the texture coordinates
and scales the width and height to get the character in the correct
aspect ratio. And then rendered a textured QUAD. 
</P>
<P><B>PutString</B> is a nice little function to put a complete
string of text on the screen. And also keep track of the width of
every character so the letters seems nicely spaced.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Anti-aliasing</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>You probably noticed that I've created a texture with both
luminance and alpha. And free-type generate anti-aliased text. So all
that remain to make things nice is to enable blending as you will see
in the main
program:<BR><B>glEnable(GL_BLEND);<BR>glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA,GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);</B></P>
<P>This also takes away the black background of the text. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Further
improvements</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Firstly you will see that much of the texture is wasted. Some
algorithm can be devised to make more complete usage of the texture.</P>
<P>Then the switch between Ortho view and Perspective viewing can be
streamlined using 2 display lists.</P>
<P>And then the printing of every character can also be enhanced by
using display lists.</P>
<P>And since we are using c++ some work can be done to make it
possible to use streams to write text to the screen. e.g. Mytextclass
&lt;&lt; &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; &lt;&lt; endl; 
</P>
<P>But this will be all for now. You are off course aloud to go wild!</P>
<H1>Part 3 &ndash; Multi-pass rendering</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>huh?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I guess your first thought would be that this is just going to
slow things down.. or maybe you were wondering if I've been drinking?
<BR>Ok no! no drinking here. But this is kinda kewl.</P>
<P>Every ran around a FPS game and when you spray your rail gun on
the walls you get all these nice little bullet holes. Or maybe when
you hit something the blood that comes out the back and hit the wall?
Not? Umm... use your imagination.</P>
<P>Anyways these things are normally done with multi-pass rendering
techniques.</P>
<P>On the first pass the wall will be drawn in one big quad or
something like that.<BR>On the second pass smaller quads will be
drawn at various locations with the texture of the bullet hole. 
</P>
<P>Great hey! So whats the fuzz?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Depth
buffer problems</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well the things is if you draw to quads in exactly the same place
you will by default see only the first one. This is not good! Since
this will mean our bullet holes gets wiped by the depth-buffer.</P>
<P>Opengl provides the capability to alter the depth buffer testing
function with <B>glDepthFunc(method)</B>.<BR>The default is GL_LESS.
Now we can change this to GL_LEQUAL.</P>
<P>In theory this should make the second quad also show and we will
see our bullet holes.. right? almost right! But not good enough.</P>
<P>You see that we work with finite accuracy floating point numbers.
In the case of a bullet hole the coordinates of will be a linear
approximation from the wall coordinates which result in a small
error.<BR>And then the coordinates gets run through some matrix
multiplication and other things. The end result is that if we render
2 Quad on top of each other they are likely to not give the same
depth values in the same places every time. You will see this in the
example if you disable the proper solution.</P>
<P>So what do we do?<BR>We tell opengl to alter the depth values
after calculation. <BR>This is done with the
<B>glPolygonOffset(factor,units)</B> function.<BR>If we enabled this
feature with <B>glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL)</B> then opengl will
alter the final depth values calculated according to the values of
factor and units we provide.</P>
<P>Don't bother with factor for now. Leave it at 0.<BR>units is a
number that is added to the final z value. A unit is the smallest
difference that the depth-buffer can monitor. <BR>This means if we
call <B>glPolygonOffset(0,-1)</B> before the second draw we are
guaranteed that the second drawn quad will be visible and there is
extremely little change that this new layer will get in front of
something else it shouldn't.</P>
<P>The example code is in <U>multi1.cpp</U>. The example is very
straight forward. I've drawn a blue stripe over a red square. You can
disable the glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL) command to see the
result without this new technique. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>what
else</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>multi-pass is many times combined with blending techniques.</P>
<P>One common technique for multi-pass rendering is shadow- &amp;
light-maps. A method to make a scene look like there is lighting
going on but in fact we don't have lighting enabled. But that is a
topic for another day.</P>
<H1>Part 4 &ndash; Multi-texturing</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>great
what is this?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Modern graphics cards have more than one texture unit. And we can
control all these texture units.</P>
<P>This firstly enables us to optimize rendering a bit by limiting
the number of texture switches required:<BR>Example we have a model
with 2 textures: A and B. so rather than switching between textures A
and B the whole time we can simple load texture A into one texture
unit and B into another and simply switch on the desired texture
unit. This sound great? 
</P>
<P>Well thats really nothing. The texture units are connected in
series. Meaning that we can have multiple texture units work on the
same geometry at the same time. This in effect gives us a multi-pass
rendering system in one go!</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>How
this work</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I have very stupid example in <U>mtext1.cpp</U>.</P>
<P>In the Setup function you will firstly find some code checking the
number of texture units. My Geforce FX 5200 have 4 of them and my old
Geforce 4 MX had 2. So I guess if you want to work on the older
hardware 2 is all you get but if you are going to program for only
the new generation cards you can expect at least 4 of them.</P>
<P>Note: Multi-texturing only became part of opengl version 1.3.</P>
<P>Firstly you must select a texture unit to work with. This is done
with:<BR><B>glActiveTexture(target)</B><BR>Where target is of the
form <B>GL_TEXTUREi</B> with i starting at 0<BR>After selecting a
texture unit the setup of a texture is as normal. <BR>Don't forget
that <B>glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D)</B> works on the current active
texture unit only!</P>
<P>Obviously we can't have a thousand texture unit changes while
rendering so passing texture coordinates works like
follows:<BR><B>glTexCoord</B> gives coordinates to texture unit 0
always!<BR><B>glMultiTexCoord*(target,coordinates)</B> is used to
give texture coordinates to a specific texture unit.</P>
<P>And as easy as that you can work multi-texturing. <BR>You can also
use Arrays to pass texture coordinates to different texture
units:<BR><B>glTexCoordPointer</B> still works the same but it
specifies the texture coordinate array for the current active texture
unit. You will also need to call <B>glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_ARRAY)</B>
for every texture unit you want to use.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Interaction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>When you have multiple texture units active you have control over
the way every texture unit interacts with the colors. This is done
using the complex <B>glTexEnv</B> command.</P>
<P>At first the specs seem to make this whole thing overly complex.
Lets try to simplify:</P>
<P>The command
is:<BR><B>glTexEnvi(target,parametername,parametervalue)</B><BR>or<BR><B>glTexEnvfv(target,paramtername,*values)</B></P>
<P>target is always <B>GL_TEXTURE_ENV</B>.<BR>(Actually there is also
GL_TEXTURE_FILTER_CONTROL but that is not for now. Check the specs
yourself.)<BR>With the first form of the command we will use the
parameter name <B>GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE</B>.<BR>And in the second form
we will use parameter name <B>GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR</B> and specify an
array of 4 color components (RGBA).<BR>If we specify
<B>GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE</B> there is 4 possible parameter
values:<BR><B>GL_MODULATE<BR>GL_DECAL<BR>GL_BLEND<BR>GL_REPLACE</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Each of these have a different result.
You can check the complete table in the specs. In basics there is 3
colors involved:<BR>The incoming color. (From a previous texture unit
or specified with the glColor command)<BR>The texture color.<BR>The
env color. (Specified with GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR)<BR>All off these can
have different formats. But in essence we have 3 color components
(RGB) and 1 alpha component A.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now:<BR>MODULATE simply multiplies the
incoming colors with the texture colors. Sort off like mixing.<BR>DECAL
can only be used if the texture has a alpha channel. DECAL is like
blending the texture color with the incoming color using
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA,GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA). Use this for
regular blending.<BR>BLEND multiply the alpha channels and mix the
texture color with both the incoming and env colors. The darker the
texture color the more of the env color will be in the resulting
color. (I'm not sure what the use of this is)<BR>REPLACE simply
throws away the incoming and env colors and output the texture color.
(As far as possible)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If the extension
GL_ARB_texture_env_add is present you can also use GL_ADD_ARB. This
simply adds the texture and incoming color components together.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If GL_ARB_texture_env_combine is
present you can use GL_COMBINE_ARB. This extension gives a whole
number of new parameter names that can be set to result in a wide
number of results. Check the docs if your interested. In general
anything funky can be done with this.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If GL_ARB_texture_env_crossbar is
available then this extents the above functionality to the point
where a texture unit can access the texture colors of other texture
units.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If you have GL_ARB_texture_env_dot3
then you can use GL_DOT3_RGB_ARB and GL_DOT3_RGBA_ARB. This extent
the above functionality to compute the dot-product between different
colors. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Yes this seem a little overwhelming
doesn't it.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Uses</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well firstly multi-texturing gives us the capability to speed
things up a little if we're smart about it.</P>
<P>But more than that multi-texturing gives us the capability to
produce multi-pass results in one-go.<BR>Things like bump-mapping,
shadow-mapping and light-mapping can all be done with this.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>All
for today</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok thats enough for this tutorial. I hope you learned something
today. Well if not well, I did :)</P>
<P>Hopefully I will get to applying these techniques soon in method
like light-mapping. 
</P>
<P>Cheerios. Have fun.</P>
