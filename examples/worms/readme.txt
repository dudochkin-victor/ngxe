Worms is a program that I found somewhere on the net (I forgot where)
I did not write this program. But think that it's a kewl OpenGL demo.

Compilation- to compile use the Makefile provided. Simply type
'make worms' without the quotes of course.

To run the program you must be in X Windows. Typing 
'./worms' (without quotes) should run the program provided 
that it's already been compiled and is present in the current directory.
