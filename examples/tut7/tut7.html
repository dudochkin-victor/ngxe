<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Hey again! So you wanna learn more? Thats great. I think about
starting something new in this tutorial. And that will be to give a
quote of some sort in the introduction. (which isn't relative to
anything in the tutorial)</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Don't tell me that worry
doesn't do any good. I know better. The things I worry about don't
happen.<BR>-- Watchman Examiner</FONT></P>
<P>Ok so in this tutorial we will have:<BR>Part 1 &ndash;
Introduction to game physics<BR>Part 2 &ndash; Vertex arrays<BR>Part
3 &ndash; Simple Model</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Note</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I've taken the <B>Textureclass</B> developed in tutorial 6 and
place it in a separate file replacing the first <B>GLTextureclass</B>.
This shouldn't be a problem.<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<H1>Part 1 &ndash; game physics</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>a
physics introduction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Firstly I like to thank Jeff Molofee (NeHe) for his tutorials on
physics!</P>
<P>What we're going to look at is basic mechanics. Some of you might
have seen this in the classroom in school.</P>
<P>Newton (this dude was kinda smart) made 3 laws to govern
motion:<BR>1. The <B>Force</B> applied is proportional to the mass
and acceleration. Giving us:<BR><B>Force</B> = <B>Mass</B> *
<B>Acceleration</B><BR>This is the most important law<BR>2. All
internal forces on a system netto result is zero. The result of this
is that you cannot pick yourself up. <BR>Don't worry if you don't get
this. <BR>3. For every force there is a force of the exact same
strength acting in the opposite direction.<BR>E.g. If you apply a
force of 10Newton on the wall with your hand then there is a force
from the wall applying 10Newtons to your hand in the opposite
direction.</P>
<P>Ok so I lost you hey? Ok don't worry! For starters just try to get
rule number 1 at least.<BR>If we apply more force we accelerate
faster. Acceleration is the change in speed per unit of time.
(m/s<SUP>2</SUP>)<BR>Speed is the change in position per second of
time. (m/s)<BR>For constant Force a Heavier object will accelerate
slower. 
</P>
<P>What is mass? <B>Mass</B> is measured in Kilograms. Mass does not
change with gravity. Mass only depends on the amount of atoms in the
object. :) 
</P>
<P>And gravity is a downwards force that is proportional to the Mass
of the object. This resulting in the fall acceleration of all object
no matter the Weight or Mass is the same. Off course there is
something like air-resistance to complicate matters.</P>
<P>Air resistance is a force that is proportional to a constant
determined by the objects shape and also proportional to the speed
squared. (F = alpha * speed<SUP>2</SUP>) 
</P>
<P>Just hang onto your seats where going to go hyper-speed in a
moment.</P>
<P>Ok Einstein made some laws about how time, mass and length change
with speed but we will ignore those for now :D</P>
<P>Ok <B>Momentum</B>: Momentum represents the <U>kinetic energy</U>
(energy of movement) of a object.<BR>Momentum = Speed * Mass. <BR>This
is quit simple then: the heavier or faster something goes the more is
it's momentum. 
</P>
<P>You probably heard this already. But the law says that energy
cannot be lost. Just keep this in the back of your head.</P>
<P>There also exist a gravitational force between any 2 objects with
mass but for now we will also ignore this.</P>
<P>Ok thats enough for now.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Simulating</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok in the real world (I hope some of you might now where that is)
time is continues. (Ok I've heard theories that time is not continues
but for all practical purposes it is!) 
</P>
<P>But in our simulation things are not continues. We work with
frames mostly. This means time is discrete. This means that we work
with small packets of time. 
</P>
<P>The simple way to simulate a physical situation is to take the
current state of masses and calculate the netto force on every
object. Then we calculate the acceleration. Change the speed. And
calculate the next position for the next time frame. We just loop
through this process as the simulation continue. 
</P>
<P>For a while this will work brilliantly! And it's easy. But when
the change in position of objects between time frames becomes bigger
the accuracy of the simulation decreases. There is 2 ways to overcome
this problem. One is to make that time steps smaller. Which require
more processing power. And the other solution is to use differential
equations in the simulation. Where not going to look at that now. And
I wonder if there is any games out there that use that kind of
intense physics. 
</P>
<P>Ok now if you've followed all this nicely you could probably
already apply this to your programming. <BR>But there is still an
example. <U>phys1.cpp</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Example</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The example is very simple. The ball starts at the bottom left.
And it gets an initial velocity that shoots it in a direction sorta
away upwards to the right. (As if the ball comes out of a cannon)</P>
<P>Firstly gravity is acting on the ball to slow its upwards descent
and eventually bring it down again. Leaving the screen at the bottom.</P>
<P>There is also a wind blowing from left to right. You can clearly
see the effect of this on the ball. 
</P>
<P>The initial velocity component in the z direction of the ball
remains unchallenged.</P>
<P>Go look in the example everything is very clear I would say. The
ball has mass,position, velocity and acceleration. <BR>The <B>ResetForce</B>
function is called in the beginning of every time frame. This resets
acceleration to 0. As if no forces are acting on the object.<BR>Next
we can call <B>AddForce</B> and <B>AddGravity</B> to add forces on
the object.<BR>The <B>Update(timepassed)</B> function calculates the
new velocity and position of the object according to the acceleration
values calculated from the forces and scales it according to the
amount of time passed. The result is that the simulation will more or
less give the same result regardless of the frame rate.<BR>I also
included a <B>Translate</B> function to help in drawing the object at
the correct location. The proper way would be to either build on top
of this object using inheritance or encapsulate this object in
another.</P>
<P>Feel free to play with the ball setup value and the force values.
Or in fact you can do whatever you want with the code. ;)</P>
<P>Ok we will continue with more simulation stuff in Tutorial 8
hopefully.</P>
<H1>Part 2 &ndash; Vertex arrays and some other arrays</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>arrays...
buts thats amateur man!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well not actually we didn't do anything non-amateur :P<BR>Everybody
that knows anything about game programming knows that speed is
absolutely crucial. The main reason people buy new hardware is
because its faster. But we need to know how to use the hardware
efficiently!</P>
<P>I called this section &ldquo;Vertex array&rdquo; but that strictly
not the correct way. What it basicly mean is we put the vertex data
which could be coordinates, colors, textures coordinates, normals
ect. All of these we put in arrays. And then we simply tell opengl
where the array is and opengl gets the data from there. Then we no
longer have to write thousands of glVertex and glColor ect ect
statements. Which also means the program runs faster.</P>
<P>And we can also use the vertex buffer object extension (made part
of core opengl version 1.5) to store these arrays on the graphics
cards memory. Which would speed up things since we don't have to send
the data to the graphics card but makes it more difficult to modify
the data. But there is a few tricks ;)</P>
<P>Yes I know the example is almost 2 simple! But thats the idea. I
simply want you to get a basic grasp of the technique. Actually its
fairly easy and straight forward.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>implementing</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well in basically you have 3 steps to complete:<BR>1. Get the data
into an array of some sort<BR>2. Tell OpenGL about this array.
Optionally load the data into the graphics cards memory.<BR>3. Ask
OpenGL to render from the array.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Example</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Go look in the example code: <U>arrays1.cpp</U></P>
<P>Lets first look at the usage of arrays without buffer objects. You
will see I've created 2 static arrays with my hand to form a box. One
for the vertices and one for the colors.</P>
<P>Ok go to function <B>Setup</B>. There you will see 2 glEnable
commands with <B>GL_VERTEX_ARRAY</B> and <B>GL_COLOR_ARRAY</B>. This
tells opengl to draw using these commands. They don't have any effect
in the Setup function but according to these states opengl decides
what information to use when we call drawing routines inside the <B>Draw</B>
function.</P>
<P>Now skip all the code for USEBUFFEROBJECT. Then you
see:<BR><B>glVertexPointer(3,GL_FLOAT,0,box);<BR>glColorPointer(3,GL_FLOAT,0,colors);</B><BR>These
commands tell opengl that the Color and Vertex information is in the
arrays pointed to by <B>box</B> and <B>colors</B>. There is 3 values
per component. (x,y,z for vertices and RGB for colors) Things like
texture coordinates only have 2 value normally. And the data is of
type <B>GLfloat</B> in the memory.<BR>And as easy as that opengl is
now aware of the data.</P>
<P>If you now go down to the <B>Draw</B> function you will
find:<BR><B>glDrawArrays(GL_QUADS,0,NRVERTICES)</B><BR>This command
makes a call to opengl to ask it to draw some geometry for us. The
arrays that are used is decided according to which <B>GL_*_ARRAY</B>
states have been enabled. Then they are drawn as if they are <B>GL_QUADS</B>
data. Any parameter that you can pass to <B>glBegin</B> you may pass
here. <BR>The second parameter is the index of the first vertex.<BR>The
third parameter tell opengl how many vertices there is to draw.<BR>I've
inserted some extra comments in the example to tell you about other
possibilities.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Buffer
object</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>They are available if you have the <B>GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_array</B>
extension or opengl 1.5.<BR>This is only a very small introduction to
buffer objects. See the glspecs for more information.</P>
<P>Go back to the example <U>array1.cpp</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">At the top of the program there is
some extra defines and variables. There is some constants for use
with buffer objects. They can be obtained from the glext.h file. My
list is only those that I needed for the example. And also the
defines for the 4 main functions to work with buffers. And an array
to keep the numbers of the 2 buffers we are going to create.</P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">Now if you go into the <B>Setup</B>
function you will firstly find the commands to locate these extension
functions, if they are available.</P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">Firstly we create buffers using the
<B>glGenBuffers</B> command.</P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">Before working on a certain buffer
we call <B>glBindBuffer(target,buffer)</B> to activate a specific
buffer.</P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">Then we load the data into the
buffers using <B>glBufferData(target,size,ptr,usagehint)</B>. After
doing this you may delete the data from your data structures. It is
safely inside the graphics cards memory. In our case the data is
constant so that is not possible.</P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">The last funky bit is to tell opengl
that it should use these buffers. Simply Bind a buffer and call a
<B>gl*Pointer</B> function, but with the datapointer set to <B>NULL</B>.
Then opengl will use the current active buffer object.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Other
information</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>One other thing we did not look into is Interleaved arrays. They
give the ability to store all you data into one array. Meaning that
all the information for every vertex is together. You can then use
the normal <B>gl*Pointer</B> commands to specify the array using
non-zero values for the stride value. Or you can you
<B>glInterleavedArrays</B> command to do it all in one single easy
step. See the manuals for specific information on this command.</P>
<P>You don't have to use vertices in the order they are in the array.
There is many commands (like <B>glDrawElements</B>) that you can use
to specify a indexing array that has the list of the vertices to use.
(Don't confuse this with <B>glIndexPointer</B> they are not related)
And you can even store this array of indices in a buffer object using
the target: <B>GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</B> <BR>Just remember that
indexing will be slower.</P>
<P>Ok thats about it for now about these. Vertex arrays and Buffer
objects usually means great increase in speed. Use them if you can.
And many times this will make your application look more neatly.</P>
<H1>Part 3 &ndash; Simple Model</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>models!!
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>Ok please note that this is only a simple introduction to models.
We will hopefully see more about this later on. The model format
we're going to look at is MD2 (Quake 2 models) why? because they are
easy!</P>
<P>I like to thank: <B>DigiBen, Daniel E. Schoenblum and Trent Polack</B>
for there information,tutorials and code on MD2 models that I used in
creating this. 
</P>
<P>The example is in the <U>md2</U> directory.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>a
simple model in theory</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>A model is in essence a well organized bit of geometry. :)</P>
<P>Lets start by saying our model consists out of triangles only.
(like MD2 models)<BR>Every triangle needs 3 vertices, 3 different
texture coordinates, and 1 or 3 normals.<BR>We are not going to worry
about normals. (MD2 uses some crazy way to get normals)</P>
<P>But thats not good enough. We want the model to be animated. MD2
uses a simple method called keyframe animations. It stores keyframes
in the file. Every frame contains vertices for every triangle. We
could reconstruct the original intended animations by interpolating
between these keyframes. But we are not going to do this since this a
outdated method.</P>
<P>And lastly it would be great if we could quickly draw the whole
model as fast as possible. Normally using GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP and
GL_TRIANGLE_FAN commands rather than GL_TRIANGLES will be faster
since less vertices are passed. And in a model there is usually a lot
of trangles that may be organized into strips and fans.</P>
<P>MD2 models already have things sorted out for us to use as
triangle strips/fans.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Model
in memory</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>If you look at <B>Md2Modelclass</B> in the example. The only
information we have is the texture coordinates, which is the same for
every key frame. And then we also stored the vertices information.
For all the frames in <B>allvertices</B>. <B>curvertices</B> points
to the location somewhere in this structure for the current selected
key frame. And the most important structure is the <B>glcommands</B>
list. This constraint the information to pass to <B>glDrawArrays</B>.</P>
<P>If you go look at the <B>Draw</B> function you will see that
drawing the model from the data is actually very easy. The difficult
part is getting everything in the correct place. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Loading
the Model</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The MD2 format is quite simple. Starting with a header which is
sorta like a roadmap to the rest of the file.</P>
<P>If you look in the <U>docs</U> directory in the <U>md2</U> folder
you will get some information about the structure of a MD2 file.
There is many ways to load a model from a MD2 file. I present only
one.</P>
<P>I started by loading the glCommands information. The structure of
these are really freaky at first. What we try to do in the example
is:<BR>-Find out how many glcommands there is.<BR>-The vertices that
each command use<BR>-Build a lookup conversion array that will later
be used to put vertex information in the correct order.<BR>-Save the
texture coordinate information<BR>-Build the glcommands array.</P>
<P>The only information we now still need is the coordinates of these
vertices. And this is stored in the frames. So we load the frames
information. What is done is to take the coordinate information from
the frames which is in unsigned byte (value 0-255) form and use the
scale and translate information provided to convert them back to
floating point values. And we also use our lookup array (created
earlier) to load only the vertices we really need and put that in the
correct order in the data arrays.</P>
<P>To display the model now is easy! Simply tell opengl about the
arrays and call glDrawArrays with the information contained in
<B>glcommands</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>further
improvement</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well off course it would be nice if we can calculate normals and
enable lighting. And also to correctly interpolate between the key
frames and get some nice animations going. But this is not the aim
here.</P>
<P>Some things to make things more smoothly and faster:<BR>-Put all
strips and all fans together and end up calling only 2
<B>glMultiDrawArrays</B> commands.<BR>-Use buffer objects.<BR>-Make a
display list for the drawing part.<BR>-Better integrate the
<B>Textureclass</B> into the model class.<BR>-Enable culling :)</P>
<P>One problem I have is that the current Textureclass cannot load
8-bit bmp files. So I had to convert the texture to a 24-bit bmp
file. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>goodbye</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>And thats it for this tutorial!</P>
<P>There is so much to choose from for writing tutorials. I will
start with some more physics but further I cannot say yet.</P>
<P>I hope you are having fun programming!</P>
