<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Tutorial 5</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Hi again! 
</P>
<P>You already now mostly everything used in this tutorial. But we
need to do quite some work before having our example finished. The
example program is quite big and I've split the stuff into multiple
files as far as possible.</P>
<P>The following tasks lie ahead of us:<BR>Part 1 &ndash; a Texture
handling class.<BR>We will create a slightly more usable texture
class for the demo.<BR>Part 2 &ndash; Drawing the sky-box<BR>This
part is relatively easy if you understand the logic<BR>Part 3 &ndash;
Draw some geometry in our 3D world<BR>Also easy enough I'll say.<BR>Part
4 &ndash; Create a class to simulate the idea of flying around the
world.<BR>This is neat and gives the thing the &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo;
we wanted.<BR>Part 5 &ndash; Add some lighting.<BR>Just to add that
last wanted effect to our new world or rather universe.</P>
<P>The complete example is compiled to <B>solarsystem</B>. Start
looking in solar.cpp at the code or follow the tutorial...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>example
controls</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>View by moving the mouse.<BR>Move around using the w,s,a and d
keys on the keyboard.<BR>Press F1 to grab the mouse and prevent the
mouse from leaving the window.<BR>Press F2 to release the mouse
again.<BR>Press ESC to quit the program.</P>
<H1>Part 1 &ndash; Texturing</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Why
you do this?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well I wanted texture handling to be a bit more &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;
and also move the code to a class of there own. Getting all that
texture loading code out of my face. So I create the <B>GLTextureclass</B>.
The source files is <U>texture.h</U> and <U>texture.cpp</U>. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Whats
going on</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well this is purely straight forward. The class automatically
creates a opengl texture and frees it with the destructor. The 2 main
functions is:<BR><B>Load</B> which is a copy of the code from
tutorial 3. I've contemplated to start using the SDL_image library
which has a function IMG_Load that can load almost any image type.
But decided that there's no need to do that as yet. And then nobody
needs to download yet another library just to compile/run the
example. <BR><B>Activate</B> which binds this texture making it the
current texture being used.</P>
<P>The other 2 functions wasn't really necessary but here
goes:<BR><B>SetWrap</B> uses the <B>glTexParameter</B> command to set
the <B>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_* </B>values. What happens is that when you
specify a texture coordinate outside the 1x1 region that defines the
texture opengl has to decide what to do. The default is to repeat the
texture. The result is that when I say to map the texture from
coordinates 0,0 to 2,2 the texture is pasted on the 4 times. The
default is GL_REPEAT. And is what you normally want. But I've
included the code for completeness.<BR><B>SetLinearFilter</B> changes
the filter method to <B>GL_LINEAR</B>. The default filter that the
class chooses on Loading a texture is <B>GL_NEAREST</B>. <B>GL_LINEAR</B>
looks nicer because some interpolation of pixel colors are used to
determine what must be displayed. But this is also slower. The best
way is off course MipMapping but that will have to wait for another
tutorial.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
example</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The main body of the example is in <U>solar.cpp</U>. You won't
really see anything of the new texture class directly in there. But
the texture class is used both inside the SkyBox and Planet classes.
What you might notice is that both Texturing and Culling is switched
on.</P>
<P>Yes I am aware that the example contains a lot of code and that
things might seem confusing. Try to focus only on a part at a time
and things will make sense. You are not required to understand every
line of code, but rather the idea is that you must be able to apply
the techniques in your own applications.</P>
<H1>Part 2 &ndash; Sky Box</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
concept</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>As in the example we want to project some background with the idea
that it is infinitely far away. You will see this is many games. And
it's quite easy to create.</P>
<P>The solution is not to draw something very far and hope it works.
Some things to keep in mind:<BR>You cannot really draw something
infinitely far.<BR>The camera setup has a zfar clipping region.
Meaning things to far away is invisible.</P>
<P>But what if we draw a box around ourselves and paste a texture on
it. How would we be able to tell how big the box is? If we stand
still in the middle of the box its kinda difficult to say. But if we
can move around in the box then we would quickly be able to estimate
the size of the box. (at least relatively to the movement speed) <BR>But
if this box moves with us, so that we always remain in the center of
the box then the box would seem infinitely big. And with the help of
a nifty texture things is even more believable.</P>
<P>So the method is simple: Draw a box around the camera.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Details</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>We do not want depth_buffer interaction. Because the idea is that
the box is infinitely far away everything else should seem inside the
box. So we don't want opengl to write anything into the depth buffer
while drawing the sky box. This is done by using the <B>glDepthMask</B>
command to turn of writing to the depth buffer.<BR>Because nothing is
drawn before the sky box we don't have to disable <U>Depth testing</U>,
but you may if you want to.</P>
<P>Because the whole screen is redrawn every frame we no longer need
to clear the screen, but only the Depth buffer. You will see I've
removed the <B>GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</B> from the <B>glClear</B>
command in the <B>DrawScene</B> function in <U>solar.cpp</U>. 
</P>
<P>The last important thing is the order in things happen. First
rotate the camera then draw the skybox and then move the camera
before drawing the rest of the geometry.</P>
<P>And off course we disable lighting before drawing the box.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Example</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>In the example code I've created a <B>SkyBox</B> class in <U>skybox.h</U>
and <U>skybox.cpp</U>.</P>
<P>There is 3 functions:<BR><B>Load</B> which Load the texture for
the SkyBox. And also creates the display list for drawing the
Box.<BR><B>Draw</B> which displays the sky box by simply calling the
display list.<BR><B>DrawBox</B> is a private function called by Load
during the Compilation of the display list.</P>
<P>In the display list is also the commands to disable writing to the
depth buffer and to activate the correct texture. Disabling of
lighting can also be added but that makes the assumption that
lighting do exist in the scene.<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<H1>Part 3 &ndash; Some geometry</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
solar system</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I've created a class called <B>Planetclass</B>. The result is that
we can specify some planets rotating around the y axis and thus
creating the solar system. The example has a &ldquo;star&rdquo; and 3
planets revolving around it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Planets</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The <B>Planetclass</B> is in <U>planet.h</U> and <U>planet.cpp</U>.
Every planet is a sphere. So therefore we need only one sphere
drawing function for all planets. Therefore the display list in
planetclass is static, ie. all planet classes shares this display
list. 
</P>
<P>When the first planetclass object is constructed the constructed
creates the display list. The display list is simply create by a call
to <B>gluSphere</B>. The sphere is of radius one. Every planet has
it's own parameters:<BR>Distance from the center.<BR>Size of planet
(radius).<BR>Speed of revolving around the center (Star)<BR>Speed of
turning around it's own axis.<BR>All these parameters can be changed
using the <B>Set</B> function.</P>
<P>If you look in <U>solar.cpp</U> you will se where the planet's
textures are loaded and how there parameters are set before the main
programming loop.</P>
<P>To display a planet the <B>Draw</B> function is used.<BR>Go look
at the code of <B>Planetclass::Draw</B>.<BR>The new commands
<B>glPushMatrix</B> and <B>glPopMatrix</B> is used to save and
restore matrix states. When you call glPushMatrix the current matrix
is placed on a stack. (The stack does have a maximum size) And when
you call glPopMatrix the matrix is removed from the stack again and
all in between changes is removed. This is very handy. <BR>Before
<B>Draw</B> can call the display list to draw the sphere we must use
rotation scaling and translation to make sure the sphere is drawn in
the correct location. And also activate the correct texture to use.</P>
<P>The last thing is the <B>Update</B> function. This function
updates the position of the planet according to the amount of time
that elapsed. This makes the planet appear to both revolve around the
&ldquo;star&rdquo; and also turn around it's axis.</P>
<P>The star is also a planet that has zero distance from the centre.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>What
to learn</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The planets class is really simple actually. But it is a good
example of how to use a display list to display multiple things that
might not seem all that similar in the end. And also how to use
transformations of the Model view matrix to move things around and
display things in different places.</P>
<P>I've actually written the planets and camera code at the same
time. Without the ability to view around the example seems very dull.</P>
<H1>Part 4 &ndash; Flying around</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Camera</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I've created the <B>Cameraclass</B> by starting with building on
top of the <B>SDLevent</B> class. The code is in <U>camera.h</U> and
<U>camera.cpp</U>. 
</P>
<P>The camera has basically 2 things:<BR>The direction it is
looking.<BR>The location in the 3D universe.</P>
<P>Because the <B>Cameraclass</B> is on top of the <B>SDLevent</B>
class we need a new <B>ProcessEvent</B> function. The new thing in
the function is that the mouse motion is monitored and the view
direction of the camera is altered according to the mouse movement. 
</P>
<P>In the <B>Update</B> function the movement keys w,s,a &amp; d is
checked and the position is altered according to the current viewing
direction. The update function uses some basic trigonometry maths to
calculate movement. Don't worry to much about this. This is far from
the proper way of handling movement inside 3D games. But will be fine
for the example.</P>
<P>The 2 functions <B>Rotate</B> and <B>Move</B> are used to get the
correct location for the camera. Altering the projection matrix. They
are separate functions to allow us to draw the sky box before moving
the camera. This is important.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Projection
vs. Model view</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The projection matrix and the model view matrix works together but
sometimes against each other. <BR>E.g. doing Translatef(1,0,0) in the
projection matrix has the same effect as Translatef(-1,0,0) in the
modelview matrix.</P>
<P>You can mostly get the same effect in either on of these matrices.
The main differences is that the modelview matrix has a much larger
stack while things like the way the camera is &ldquo;focuses&rdquo;
and near/far clipping regions can only be done in the projection
matrix.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Grabbing
the input</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>In the application we view with the mouse. But if we use windowed
display this is very irritating because moving the mouse out of the
window stops the camera from rotating. 
</P>
<P>SDL gives us the ability to grab the input of the both the mouse
and keyboard. The result is that the mouse cannot leave the window.
And the window manager will not longer catch keys before us. (Like
shortcuts maybe)</P>
<P>One other important thing to note is the
<B>SDL_ShowCursor(SDL_DISABLE)</B> command in <U>solar.cpp</U>. This
makes the mouse pointer invisible. Which is what we want. And also
now the mouse pointer no longer sticks at the edge of the screen.
Allowing continues movement in all directions from the mouse. Exactly
how you want things in your new action fps.</P>
<H1>Part 5 &ndash; Lighting</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Why?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well lighting lets the scene look more realistic. The planets are
only receiving light from the &ldquo;star&rdquo; and no longer from
all directions. We have night and day. And this makes the whole scene
more convincing to the eye.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
insides.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>There is only one light in the solar system. And that is the light
shining from the star in the middle.<BR>the light is used with all
it's mostly default settings. 
</P>
<P>Firstly note that lighting is switched off for the sky box. 
</P>
<P>Then notice that since the light is inside the &ldquo;star&rdquo;.
The light hits all the back sides of the star and thus never
illuminating the star. So no light coming from the star :(<BR>The
solution is to alter the GL_EMISSION property of the stars material.
I gave the star a dark reddish type emission. And with the texture I
got you might just convince yourself that there is something burning
on the surface.</P>
<P>Combining textures and lighting can have some really funky
results.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Making
the scene even more convincing</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Firstly it doesn't take much looking around to see that the sky
box doesn't do such a great job. Apart from getting a better texture
we can maybe use another shape. The box is the simplest shape to use.
But a sphere would do a much better job. Then every point on the
&ldquo;skysphere&rdquo; will be the same distance from the camera
unlike the box where the corners makes funny visual results. 
</P>
<P>The default setup for the light is no attenuation. But in a real
solar system the planets further away will get less light than those
closer. By setting the attenuation factors of the light this can be
implemented.</P>
<P>The star doesn't really look like it's shining. Improving the
situation can be difficult. I'll leave solutions to your imagination
for now. We don't know enough yet to do this.</P>
<P>Having populated planets where you can see the city lights on the
night side. This is also fairly difficult but will look kewl.</P>
<P>Moons will be nice. And lastly shadows! 
</P>
<P>And then there is a many other small enhancements you can make to
the scene :)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Lastly</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well I had lotsa fun creating this tutorial. And I hope what you
see here will inspire you to continue the road of learning how to do
all sorts of funky graphics things. 
</P>
<P>The main things about this tutorial was to give you an idea of
putting things together to build up something that looks like
something.</P>
<P>In the next tutorial I we will look at Mipmaps, blending and Fog. 
</P>
<P>Enjoy life!</P>
