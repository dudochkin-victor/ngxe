<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Hi, my name is Heinrich.</P>
<P>Firstly I like to thank NeHe for there absolutely briljant
tutorials and web-site. Most if what I've ever learned about OpenGL
is from those tutorials. So why create yet another set of tutorials
you ask?</P>
<P>Well I always had this idea that the best way to make sure you
understand something is to teach it to another. And then having my
compiler project standing still due to lack of motivation for that
crappy Rabbit Z180 type architecture and my OS project standing still
due to the lack of a nice 64-bit processor. Not to mention the fact
that AMD and Intel seem to take different roads in modern cpu
development. And then I'm just not quite in the mood for DirectX
right now. Well I have to admin that what I've seen so far is pretty
neat. I don't believe either OpenGL or DX is the best. It does sadden
me that we as yet do not have DX linux drivers :)</P>
<P>Ok enough chit-chat. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Documentation</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Every programmer knows that you go now where without
documentation. A reference on the subject at hand is always important
and very handy. I don't think very many of us learn by heart every
detail of say the complete opengl specification. 
</P>
<P>We will assume we have atleast OpenGL 1.4. Yes Version 2.0 is out
there. But most of the things in version 2.0 is already in 1.4 or 1.5
as extensions. Where differences occur I will point them out. We will
come to the Shader language after a few tutorials. But there is a big
number of things to cover before we ge there. 
</P>
<P>I suggest getting your hands on the OpenGL spec atleast version
1.4. Version 1.1 will probably do for the first few tutorials. As
most of the real basics never changed. For a start documentation on
the new shader language is not needed. I will specify documentation
on that later. I have installed on my system man pages for all the
opengl functions. But any sort of reference will come in very handy.</P>
<P>I will use the SDL library for basic setup of the screen and input
from mouse/keyboard. SDL language is available for free on there
web-site. The SDL API is fairly simple and you wouldn't really need
the documentation for the tutorials. I will explain some of the
basics as we go along.</P>
<P>Lastly I will use c++ as my programming language. Using the g++
compiler for now. No I'm not intrested in porting anything to visual
c++ for now. There is many many documenation and books out there for
learning c++. And I will pressume you know atleast the basics for
this. I believe that OOP is the future. And in my opinion Java is not
a game programming platvorm, that leaving c++ the only option for
now. The D programming language developed by digital mars looks good
and maybe I will look into it before the end of these tutorials. The
idea of the tutorials is not to be bound to any specific language,
but we need a language to program hey :)</P>
<P>I'm using GNU Debian Linux as a OS. I have a Geforce FX 5200
graphics card at the moment. That was infact the cheapest DirectX 9
card I could buy. I think my Nvidia drivers is out-dated by a few
months. But so is just about every thing :(</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>What
now</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>That is about it for tutorial 0. In tutorial 1 I will start with
the basics of setting up a window and displaying something in it
maybe. I will try to move beyond the basic immediate mode stuff as
soon as possible and get to something feasable.</P>
<P>In later tutorials I will start working with models as such. The
model program I recommend is Blender. Blender is competely free. And
it supports Python plugins to export custom data. Python is not all
that difficult and standard documentation is available with
tutorials. Blender is in my opinion a most excelent model editor.
Althought learning Blender is slightly more difficult than your
average paint program. Many tutorials and documentation is available
on the web. And I think it will be worth your while learning atleas
the basics of blender as a feature game programmer. Atleast for the
moment before you have somebody else that models things for you. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Lets
GO</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Might I say that althought these tutorials firstly was written for
myself I wish that they will be usefull to somebody out there.</P>
<P>I found that nothing good comes cheap in life. Nothing worth while
without hard work. And generally when we get things cheap and easy
they seem to be worth less to us. Thus I would like to say there is
no shortcuts here either. You will not become a great game programmer
without putting your back into this.</P>
<P>You can email me at 13806335 at sun.ac.za for now. Although that
email will expire end of 2005.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Last
personal note</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Althought programming is something I like and love and take up a
lot of my programming this is not the most important thing in my
life. Neither is my family or a girlfriend.</P>
<P>The single most important Person in this world is Jesus Christ. I
have the priviledge of knowing this man as my Lord and Saviour. I
really believe that no person on this earth can find peace without
knowing Jesus. 
</P>
<P>Many people in this world do not believe in God or in Jesus for
that matter. I know that every argument has a argument against it.
And with the ideas of evolution and humanism storming our world its
becoming more difficult to stand up for the truth since truth has
become relative they say. I can spend some time telling you how my
life changed and meaning was added when I met Jesus. But you don't
know me personally. But what I would like to tell you is that there
is more than enough proof in this life that God exists. As of yet
evolution can not be proven scientifically without using lots of
unproven theories and made up facts. And it never will. I had the
experience many times to see God heal and deliver people. God is real
and the message that He sent to this world is a message of Love
through his son Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>All people have 2 things in common. One is being concieved and the
other is dying. The result of being concieved is being born unless
you die before that. We spend a big part of our lives trying to deal
with the fact that we were born. Some never get the hang of it. But
sometimes we get so busy that we forget that we should also deal with
the fact that we will die someday. Whatever you believe right now
this is a valid question. Are you ready? Are you sure what you
believe is true? What if you are wrong?</P>
<P>I don't know how you expect me to end this message but I would end
it with saying:</P>
<P>GOD IS TRULY AMAZINGLY AWSOME.</P>
