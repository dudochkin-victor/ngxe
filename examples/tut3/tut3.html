<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Tutorial 3</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Hi again. In this tutorial I want to add quite a few things. You
might notice I've never spend much time on drawing primitives such as
the pyramid in tutorial 2. The reason is simple. If you've seen the
triangle in tutorial 1 and you have the red-book version 1.0 you can
do everything there is to it. And besides I like to move to things
beyond that. Faster ways of drawing things. Plus just about every
tutorial on opengl spend lots off time on that stuff. The idea of
these tutorials are not to replace all others. They are to complement
the rest.</P>
<P>So what we learn today you ask? (Actually its night) Ok here we go</P>
<P>Part 1 will be on basic lighting.<BR>Part 2 will be on texture
mapping.<BR><BR>That should be enough hey? But please note that this
tutorial will only be a basic introduction on these topics.</P>
<H1>Part 1 &ndash; Lighting</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>so
whats the fuzz?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Basically lighting is easy. You tell opengl about the light and
your graphics card crunches out the correct results. The problem is
that mainly that most you aren't really capable of using all 8 lights
and still get the frame rate you were hoping for. And then in the end
creating a magnificent looking scene using lighting is art. There is
no 3 steps to making lighting brilliant. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>How
lighting works</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well opengl gives us a gazillion options for lighting. Lets try to
break down the complexity a bit at first.</P>
<P>When you run the example (<U>light1</U>) you see a sphere with a
light moving around the sphere. What you want to know is how this
works right?</P>
<P>In this new light filled 3D world we no longer have simply colors
for the geometry. No we have materials now. Material properties tell
opengl how the light interact with the surface. There is four types
of light that is simulated in opengl. Using them as an approximation
of the real-world. And if you do things well you. Hey things look
good! 
</P>
<P>AMBIENT light is the light that is sorta all around. It comes from
all directions and goes in all directions.<BR>DIFFUSE light comes
from a light source. It comes from one direction only and them when
it hits a surface it scatters in all directions. The intensity of the
light that comes of depends on the angle it hits the
surface.<BR>SPECULAR light comes from a source. And then reflects
like a mirror of the object. <BR>EMISSION is light the the material
itself gives out. 
</P>
<P>Lets look at a light. Opengl supports at least 8 light sources.
(there may be more but this is completely impractical for performance
based applications) <BR>Firstly a light has a position. Then it has
ambient, diffuse and specular light properties. This is the
basics.<BR>Beyond this we can make a spotlight by letting the light
shine in a defined direction. <BR>And then we can set the ATTENUATION
of the light which affect how the light fall off with distance.</P>
<P>Ok lets look at material. Firstly material has ambient and diffuse
properties. This defines how the material reacts and reflects these
kind of light. This is pretty straight forward. Then the material has
an emission property which is light the material emits. This will in
effect make an object visible even if now light source or ambient
light is available. (Maybe the coals of a burnt out fire after the
bad guys had run into the woods?)<BR>The specular property defines
how the material reflects specular light. Now remember that specular
light reflects mirror like from a surface! To tell opengl exactly how
directly the light reflect we use the SHININESS property. I used a
value of 100 in the example and got a nice reflective effect on the
sphere.<BR><BR>Lastly there is a world ambient light that doesn't
come from any light but is in the world. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Normals</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>For opengl to be able to do all these new calculations with light
it needs some new information. This information tell opengl which way
is upwards. (directly 90 degrees perpendicular to the surface) This
is called normals. Every vertex must have a normal. In the example
the gluSphere command that draws the sphere generate normals
automatically for the sphere. But in many other cases we need to
supply normals ourselves. The simplest way todo this is using the
<B>glNormal</B> command. (usually with <B>3f</B> extension).</P>
<P>OpenGL expects normals to be normalized. That means there length
is exactly 1. Else the light will be either to light or too dark. If
you are unable to normalize the normals you can tell OpenGL to do
normalizing for you by setting <B>glEnable(GL_NORMALIZE)</B> but this
will probably result in a performance penalty. But don't worry most
modeling programs calculate normals for you. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Lighting
commands</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>In the example most of the lighting setup is done in the
<B>setuplight</B> function. 
</P>
<P>The lights are called by the opengl identifiers GL_LIGHTi where i
is the number of the light.<BR>All of the lights properties are set
using <B>glLightfv(light,property,newvalue)</B> The example code is
fairly clear on what must happen. It sets the 3 light properties of
LIGHT0. You can change there values and see what happens.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">We set the world ambient light using
<B>glLightModelfv(property,newvalue)</B>. This will affect the
overall brightness/darkness of the seen.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Next we want to enable
lighting:<BR><B>glEnable(GL_LIGHT0)</B> switches light 0 on.
<BR><B>glEnable(GL_LIGHTING)</B> switches on global lighting mode.
Opengl will do light calculation from now on.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Material
commands</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">All material properties can be set
using <B>glMaterialf</B> and <B>glMaterialfv</B> commands. <BR>In the
form <B>glMaterial(face,property,newvalue)</B>. I've specified both
front and back faces in all cases but actually opengl only uses the
front face by default. You will understand more about faces later on.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">There is a faster better way to update
material properties: Since we no longer use <B>glColor</B> for
setting the color of the surface. We can now use <B>glColor</B> to
change the material properties. (According to documentation this is
the preferred way.) <BR>Firstly we tell opengl which properties of
the material <B>glColor</B> should affect with:
<BR><B>glColorMaterial(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK,GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE)</B>;<BR>Choosing
ambient and diffuse affects the general colour of the object. And
thus glColor have more or less the same result as you would expect it
to have.<BR>Then enable this capability with
<B>glEnable(GL_COLOR_MATERIAL)</B>.</P>
<P>Just before the <B>gluSphere</B> command in the example there is a
<B>glColor3f</B> command that sets the ambient and diffuse properties
of the sphere.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Last
Notes on lighting for now</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Go play with the example and change the values to get the feel of
how these things works. As I said at the start of this thing.
Lighting is art.<BR>If things in your application looks funny its
quite likely you have forgotten something.</P>
<P>You will probably never again get rid of lighting, so its best to
get a good grasp of what is up with it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Quadrics</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>You might be asking what this gluSphere command is hey? Well the
glu library gives some basic 3D geometry commands it calls quadrics.
The available forms are:<BR>SPHERE &ndash; a round ball
thing<BR>CYLINDER &ndash; like a straight pipe<BR>DISK &ndash; can be
like a pizza or a CD. <BR>PARTIALDISK &ndash; a pizza with some
missing slices ;)</P>
<P>You start by declaring a <B>GLUquadric</B> object and create it
using <B>gluNewQuadric</B>.<BR><BR>And then you can draw the quadric
using one of the following
commands:<BR><B>gluSphere(quadric,radius,slices,stacks)</B> &ndash;
slices and stacks determines the number of faces used to built up the
sphere.<BR><B>gluCylinder(quadric,baseradius,topradius,height,slices,stacks)<BR>gluDisk(quadric,innerradius,outerradius,slices,loops)<BR>gluPartialDisk(quadric,innerradius,outerradius,slices,loops,startangle,sweepangle)</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Fairly easy I'll say.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Light
classes</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I've created to classes <B>GLLightclass</B>
and <B>GLMaterialClass</B>. They are in material.cpp/h and
light.cpp/h. These classes include the basic functionality to handle
these new OpenGL capabilities. I will use them in the following
tutorials.</P>
<H1>Part 2 &ndash; Textures</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Wow
cool</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Yes textures are cool. But where do we start with explaining this?</P>
<P>Textures is the process of sticking pictures/bitmaps on geometry.
So we no longer have only colors and materials. We can now apply a
nice looking pattern to the geometry. The result is that we need
fewer primitives (Triangles and Quads) and we have more detail in the
end.</P>
<P>OpenGL support many different texture capabilities and formats.
All this is so complex that we will use the glu library to help us
out. 
</P>
<P>We will only look into basic 2D textures for now and there basic
usage. All the advance topics will have to wait for a next tutorial.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>The example code is in texture1.cpp</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>What
must be done</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Firstly we need to ask OpenGL to
create a texture. Using <B>glGenTextures</B>.<BR>Then we bind a
texture to a texture target. Using <B>glBindTexture</B>.<BR>There is
a few targets but for now we will simply use <B>GL_TEXTURE_2D</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Next we tell opengl how to handle the
texture when it is either <U>Mag</U>nified or <U>Min</U>ified. <BR>For
the example I've set both GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER and
GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER to GL_NEAREST.<BR>GL_NEAREST is the fastest way
of scaling textures but also produces the worst visual results. We
will look into more detail on this in a later tutorial.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now we load the image from file using
<B>SDL_LoadBMP</B>. Using the SDL_Image library we can load any
format.<BR>But we have a slight problem. We need to tell opengl the
format of the image. And also need to flip the image. Because the y
axis is upwards and not downwards in opengl. In the example there
follows quite a bit of code to figure out which paramenters to send
opengl and also to flip the image by copying it into a new buffer.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now we can tell opengl to create the
texture using <B>glTexImage2D</B>. If everything is ok we will have a
new usable texture now.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The last thing to do is to enable
texturing using <B>glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D)</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>What
else?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Well, what else is pretty unlimited.
Textures plays a big part in the rendering of most graphics
applications. OpenGL provides hundreds of options and there exists
thousands of possibilities when it comes to textures mapping.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">We can start by mentioning that mostly
the width and height of a texture must be 2^(n) (2,4,8,16, ect) And
some platforms doesn't support textures larger than 64x64. Although
this is mostly ancient systems and I think that the width and height
restriction is also no longer there on all platforms?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">There exist so many possibilities with
textures.<BR>Next thing in textures is probably mip-mapping. A
technique to get beautifully scaled textures. And also Wrapping.
<BR>Then we might look at compressed textures and also texture
proxying. And off course the multi-texturing capabilities of opengl.
All this is to increase speed.<BR>Then there is 3D textures. And
there is light-maps which is a whole field on its own. And there is
bump-mapping.<BR>And Masking... And environment mapping.<BR>And
Cell-Shading. And we can also render to a texture. And then comes
shaders :D</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">But this will all have to wait, sorry.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Code</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The example code is in <U>texture1.cpp</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Most of the hard work is done in the
<B>setuptexture</B> function.<BR>I've inserted some comments to make
the code more readable.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the main program you will see some
<B>glTexCoord</B> commands for drawing the Quad.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">As easy as that. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Last
notes</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Although everything in this tutorial is still actually amateur
stuff it is very necessary to understand the basics. I hope that
maybe somebody learns something. Well I did and I had some fun
creating this tutorial.</P>
<P>All the best for ya!</P>
<P>My next tutorial will be on, umm... How about I sleep first?</P>
