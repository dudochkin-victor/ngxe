<P>Welcome to yet another tutorial on some interesting programming
things.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Windows 3.1 Beer: The world's

Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. <BR>Claims that it
allows you to drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but <BR>in
reality you can only drink a few of them, very slowly, especially
<BR>slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at the same time.

<P>Part 1 &ndash; Introduction to particle engines<BR>Part 2 -
Texture coordinate generation.<BR>Part 3 &ndash; A bit more on
collisions</P>
<H1>Part 1 &ndash; particle engine intro</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
concept</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>In basic a particle engine is a bunch of code to render a number
of particles. <BR>Every particle has some properties that determines
how the particle acts and is displayed.<BR>After a while the particle
engine will kill a particle and create a new particle.</P>
<P>Usually blending is also heavily used to enhance the general
effect of the engine but this is not required.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Rain</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>For example lets say we want to render rain. 
</P>
<P>We have a cloud above somewhere. And every particle is a drop of
water. We can maybe used a blended stretched triangle to render the
rain drop. And then with time the drops respond to gravity. Or if we
simplify the problem, they fall to the earth with a certain speed.</P>
<P>When they reach the bottom they might generate a little splash and
then the particle is destroyed.</P>
<P>As time goes on the particle engine will create new particles at a
certain height.</P>
<P>And then we have rain.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
art</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I'm not going to write the rain particle engine :)</P>
<P>Writing particle engine is build on a few principles but in the
end its an art. You need to use some imagination to conquer the
problem at hand.</P>
<P>The only thing to keep in mind is that more particles mean more
computation which will result in reduced performance. So the general
idea is to get as much results with as little as possible particles.
One way todo this is to use the blending technique and to increase
the size of the particles. While this aint always possible.<BR>We
also switch the depth buffer off many times since we work with
blending</P>
<P>Many times some physics will also find its way into a particle
engine. eg. The particles will react to wind/gravity or something
else. <BR>And lastly randomization is largely used in particle
engines.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Stupid
example</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">I've created a
very dump example. The idea in my head was of this sword blade
swinging through the air with giving off this &ldquo;magical&rdquo;
cloud of &ldquo;energy&rdquo;. This result I obtain looks like crap
:(</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">I decided not
to make a better particle engine today. I don't think I want to start
focusing on special effects just yet. If you write a brilliant
particle engine feel free to mail it to me if you think I can use it
as an example in this tutorial.</P>
<P>We have some other things to attend to..</P>
<H1>Part 2 &ndash; Texture coordinate generation</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Automatic!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Sometimes its a slept to type in all the texture coordinates. And
sometimes they need to be calculated every frame. 
</P>
<P>Opengl support some methods for automatically generating texture
coordinates. Lets check it out.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Opengl
commands</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The example code is in <U>texgen1.cpp</U>.</P>
<P>Since we still only work with 2D textures there is only 2
coordinates for textures which is called S and T.<BR>We control there
generation separately.</P>
<P>First we must tell opengl the method
used:<BR><B>glTexGeni(coord,GL_TEXTURE_GEN_MODE,mode)</B><BR>coord is
either <B>GL_S</B> or <B>GL_T</B>. And mode can be one
of:<BR><B>GL_OBJECT_LINEAR</B> &ndash; coordinate calculated using
the distance from a place in object space.<BR><B>GL_EYE_LINEAR</B> &ndash;
coordinate calculated using the distance from a plane in
eye-coordinate space. <BR><B>GL_SPHERE_MAP</B> &ndash; coordinates
generated using Normal vector and the coordinates in eye space.</P>
<P>If <B>GL_EXT_texture_cube_map</B> is available it gives a whole
new method of texture coordinate generation, but that is a topic for
another day.</P>
<P>If you use GL_OBJECT_LINEAR or GL_EYE_LINEAR you need to specify
the plane. A plane is specified using a single vector (3
coordinates). And is passed to opengl as
follows:<BR>glTexGenfv(coord,<B>GL_OBJECT_PLANE</B>,*planecoords)
or<BR>glTexGenfv(coord,<B>GL_EYE_PLANE</B>,*planecoords)</P>
<P>You will see I've specified 2 different planes for the S and T
coordinates. They were chosen carefully to nicely cover the whole
cube in the fire texture.</P>
<P>And we need to enable the texture generation mode in opengl
with:<BR><B>glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_GEN_S)</B>
and<BR><B>glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_GEN_T)</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">After this we simply draw the object
as normal and opengl creates the texture coordinates.<BR>Note that if
you use GL_SPHERE_MAP you need to supply normals for every vertex.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Uses?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well the linear modes are easy ways to sort off &ldquo;wrap&rdquo;
a texture over an object. <BR>I have this idea that these can be used
to put light-maps over complicated objects but I wont bet on it.</P>
<P>The sphere mode is used for generating the idea of reflections.
You create a sphered texture map. Easily generated in any image
program like GIMP for example. And then the things gets mapped in
such a way that it seems to be a nice reflection on the object. There
exist many many tutorials and example on sphere mapping on the web.
Actually its gives quite nice results for very little effort. But the
method has some limitations. This is also called Environment mapping.</P>
<P>The cube map extension gives a more realistic way of creating
reflections. I will try and cover that later.</P>
<H1>Part 3 &ndash; A bit more on collisions</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>were
is this going?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok we should start thinking about getting things to a place where
we can use this. In a real game you would have a slightly more
complex environment than little spheres bouncing around.</P>
<P>Ok the next object we add is a <U>face</U>. A face is basically a
flat polygon in 3D space. And then we can use a number of these
objects to construct a n-sided polygon in 3D space. In order to keep
the geometry simplified we stay with convex polygons. A cube would be
a very simple example.</P>
<P>Firstly we need the definition of a <B>plane</B>. A plane is a
flat surface in 3D space that has no boundaries. It stretches to
infinity :) <BR>A plane is simply described by one vector that
stretches from the origin and meet the plane perpendicular. This can
be confusing but don't worry.</P>
<P>Next we have a <B>line-segment</B>. A line segment is simply
defined by 2 coordinates: a start and end location so to speak.</P>
<P>And then we have a <B>point</B>. Obviously defined by a simple
point.</P>
<P>Using planes, lines and points we can construct faces and also
n-sided 3D polygons. This gives us more than enough to produce some
nice 3D collision detection environments. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>what
first</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Best not to get ahead of ourselves.</P>
<P>I'm going to start with the previous examples code and surround
the balls with 6 planes. Effectively putting the balls inside a box.
This will be enough for this tutorial :)</P>
<P>Sorry the walls are invisible for this example. We will make the
walls visible when we start to properly work with faces and polygons.</P>
<P>The solution has a few limitations at the moment:<BR>-If the
elasticity is too low the balls fall through the planes.<BR>-When a
ball do seem to &ldquo;lay&rdquo; on a plane it generates a collision
just about every frame. <BR>-It will only check the collision
correctly if the sphere is coming from the &ldquo;inside&rdquo; of
the plane.<BR>-There is some problems when multiple planes/spheres
get hit at the same time.<BR>-The simulation does not give the same
results every time. This is ok for gaming purposes, but hopefully
will will make things a little bit more accurate later.</P>
<P>The upside is that the collision code is fairly simple and should
run fast. Which is good since this is going to be used a lot.</P>
<P>Don't worry about the problems for now. We will work around them
and find solutions when needed. In a later tutorial.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Speeding
up collision detection</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well the basic principle is that firstly multiplications is a
relative measurement of time. So the less multiplications you use in
the detection the faster the code. Complex functions like sqrt take
about the time of 10 multiplications I would say?</P>
<P>Anyways the other principle we use is the fact that collisions
only happen a very small percentage of the time we check. So we
exploit this by trying to write early-exit code. We write functions
that use simpler methods at the beginning to quickly make some check
that will make sure no collision is possible and then quit the check.
This will result in faster execution time. Using more complex
mathematical formulas and functions later on will not be so bad since
they are only executed a very small percentage of the time.</P>
<P>The other thing to avoid is &ldquo;continues collision&rdquo;<BR>This
happens in the example I wrote.<BR>We need to create ways to avoid
continues collision circumstanced. Or detect them and then switch
some things to handle the situation in a different way.<BR>E.g. When
the ball stop bouncing it starts to &ldquo;roll&rdquo; on the table.
In which case we would need to switch to a different physics handling
method involving friction rather than collision.</P>
<P>This is way in the future but lets quickly talk about this. Say
you have a complex model like a dragon with wings and a tail and
horns ect ect.. ok now you shoot an arrow at this dragon. How do you
do collision detection? <BR>Firstly it would be very expensive to
test collision with every face (triangle) of the model every frame.
And secondly it is fairly complex to construct non-convex 3D polygons
and do collision detection on them using plane mechanism. And what if
there is a 100 arrows flying at the dragon?<BR>What I suggest here is
layered collision detection. E.g.<BR>Firstly you will create a
perfect sphere around the dragon that encapsulate the whole dragon.
If the arrow is inside the sphere we have a second layer of simple
polygons or maybe even more spheres. On for each segment of the
dragon. E.g. head, tail, wings, body ect.<BR>If it hits one of these
regions we might have a slightly more detailed polygon inside that to
do the final level of collision detection. <BR>This will hopefully
speed up the whole process nicely.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
maths explained</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>So a plane is defined by a simple vector. Picture this in your
imagination like follows:<BR>The vector starts at the origin (0,0,0)
and then an arrow stretches out to the given coordinates. And then
perpendicular on top of this arrow we place the infinite plane.</P>
<P>Maybe when I revise these tutorials we get some pictures :D</P>
<P>I calculate a normalized vector also because we need that in some
of the calculations.</P>
<P>Ok the answer to a <B>dot product</B> between vectors A and B is
|A||B|cos(theta) theta being the angle between the 2 vectors. (both
starting at the origin) This means that if the dot product is zero
then the angle is 90 degrees (or 270 which is just about the same
things in 3D)</P>
<P>We like to test if a point A is on the plane. So we construct a
vector starting at P and going to A. (P is the planes vector) And we
use -P as the other vector. If the dot product gives zero A is on the
plane. If positive on the one side and negative on the other side.
Easy enough.</P>
<P>Ok I made 2 methods. But we work with a sphere and not a point! So
firstly we calculate <B>epos</B>. Epos is the point on the surface of
the sphere closest to the plane. In the positive direction. These
calculations has been simplified a little. (This is why this will
only work from one side)</P>
<P>Now in the first function <B>CheckCollision(Planeclass,deltatime)</B>
we say that the position of the point is a function of time: epos +
time*vel<BR>Then we push this into the dot product which results in a
linear equation and solves this and get a time of collision. 
</P>
<P>To apply the early exit thing we first calculate a dot product to
see if the sphere is moving towards or away from the plane. 
</P>
<P>This method has a few problems but is the simplest way to get an
exact time of collision. But it is a bit slower than the second
solution in <B>CheckCollision2(Planeclass,deltatime)</B>.</P>
<P>The second solution is a bit faster but doesn't give an exact time
of collision.</P>
<P>The method is to calculate the dot product of the position with -P
before and after the movement for the given time. If either one of
them is on the place or they are on different sides of the plane a we
have a collision. 
</P>
<P>If you now go to the function <B>HandleCollision(Planeclass)</B>.</P>
<P>Firstly the velocity in the perpenducalar direction of collision
with the plane is calculated and removed from the object. And we
calculate the scaler of this velocity.</P>
<P>Then we use the elasticity value of the object to scale this
velocity and put it back into the objects velocity in the opposite
direction causing the object to bounce away.</P>
<P>You will see I removed the some code in the <B>drawscene</B>
function. This is because in cases where multiple collisions happen
at the same time we have problems with that code.</P>
<P>You might agree to some extent that this solution is sorta not
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo;: That is true.<BR>But we laid some ground work
for further physics development. <BR>We will go yet one step further
in the next tutorial.</P>
<P>As I said before, collision detection is based on 3D geometry. So
it will only do you good to get a grasp of it. Go pick up a applied
maths text book somewhere. Computing the actual physics is much more
complicated and we will simply use formulas already simplified. After
all physics is simply mathematical theory trying to predict and
estimate the real world.</P>
<H1>Quick look at fixed point maths</H1>
<P>Looking around other things you might come around to some
documentation on fixed point maths. And wonder what that is.. or
rather was! 
</P>
<P>Fixed point math is a way to simulate real numbers using 32-bit
integers. The main reason being the beginning that floating point
number is slower than fixed point numbers. And this definitely was
true on old 386 and 486 PCs (maybe even Pentium 1?) <BR>The method
involved some pretty funky techniques in some places but in the end
you build up a complete maths library with this technique.</P>
<P>BUT! With modern hardware things changed a bit. Most graphics
hardware are heavily optimized to work with floating point maths. And
your pc calculates floating point maths using a maths co-processor.
Well actually that processor is embedded in the CPU chip but still
its there. And we have numerous other hardware capabilities such as
3dnow and MMX and SSE ect ect. These things are optimize to make
calculations faster but not only that they compute in parallel to you
other code. Which results in some pretty kewl parallel processing
happening. 
</P>
<P>The result being that floating point running faster than fixed
point maths in the end. This was a nice optimization trick but it's
days are history. So don't be bothered with that, unless you like to
do something on ancient pc's or maybe embedded hardware where this
technique will still be valid.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>End
of this tut</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok thats enough for this tutorial.</P>
<P>This tutorial wasn't that successful according to me :( I'm sorry
if you feel the same.</P>
<P>But don't worry we're working towards something. I just have so
many ideas and things in my head that this its difficult to select a
next topic.
