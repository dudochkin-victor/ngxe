<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Tutorial 2</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok whats next you ask? Sorry to say but we are still only in basic
stuff and still far from anything magnificent.</P>
<P>In this tutorial there will be to parts.</P>
<P>Part1 will teach you how to use the keyboard. In the example code
I've created a class to use for the keyboard.</P>
<P>Part2 will be on opengl. I will show you how to rotate, scale and
translate an object using the modelview matrix. And I will also show
you how to use the depth buffer. 
</P>
<H1>Part1 &ndash; SDL events</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
keyboard</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I believe that most of the people reading this might have seen a
computer keyboard before. And some of the like me has opened the
thing. In basic the keyboard send the computer signals telling it how
keys are pressed and released. So actually a keyboard is a very
simple device. But since we work on a protected mode operating system
things can get a little hairy since you can't exactly replace the
keyboard interrupt handler like some of us have done in those good
old DOS days! yeah!</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>SDL
events</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>SDL makes things fairly simple. SDL has an event system which
informs our application of all sorts of things. There are events for
the mouse, the keyboard, window manager commands, joysticks and even
your own madeup events. For this tutorial we will simply be bothered
with the keyboard events and discard everything else accept the quit
event.</P>
<P>We can wait for the next event using the <B>SDL_WaitEvent</B>
command. But this is not that great for a game programmer since we
don't want to get stuck anyware waiting for a user event. That just
wouldn't be fair to all those hairy monsters in 3D world hey? So we
much rather use <B>SDL_PollEvent</B>. This command will return
immediately even if no event is available.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>SDL
keyboard</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>This is all great. But sometimes we simply wants to know if the
key is pressed or released. Now it would be possible to create all
the structures to keep track of which keys are currently pressed. But
SDL already does all this for us. Since SDL already contains an array
with this information we can simply retrieve a pointer to this
structure using <B>SDL_GetKeyState()</B>.<BR>Note: If you use this
keyboard state buffer without using SDL_PollEvent you need to call
<B>SDL_PumpEvents</B> to keep this keystate information updated.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Coding</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><U>The example code is in keys.cpp</U></P>
<P>First go and look at the main function. We start by Setting up SDL
and a small 320x200 video screen. The only reason for the video
screen is that SDL handles it's keyboard event from the video window
and not from the console. So the only way to receive keyboard events
is by creating a graphics window. Make sure the graphics window is
the active window while running the example. But the output will
appear in the console. Since the window is really small it shouldent
be a problem fitting both on your desktop.</P>
<P>Ok now we create the <B>SDLEventclass</B>. This class has very
VERY limited functionality but is there to show you the basics of
handling events. 
</P>
<P>The constructor is very simple. It sets some variables and also
located the keyboard state buffer using <B>SDL_GetKeyState</B>.
<BR><B>ProcessEvent</B> must be called periodically because this will
handle the incoming event.<BR>The <B>GetLastEvent</B> function
returns a pointer to the event structure of the last event processed
by ProcessEvent. This is here for completeness sake and is not used
in the example.<BR><B>GetKey</B> is used to lookup the state of a key
in the keyboard state buffer. If you go look in the main function you
will see there in the middle of the program loop code that says: <B>if
(events.GetKey(SDLK_UP))</B> This has the effect of continually
checking the up-arrow key and printing the message if the key is
pressed. Run the example and press the up-arrow key and see how the
console is flooded with the repeated message, even thought no new
events is received from the keyboard.<BR><B>GetKeySafe</B> is the
same as GetKey, accept that it does a check to see if the provided
keysym is valid. Use this if you are not sure if the keysym is
valid.<BR><B>CheckKeySym</B> is a small function that validates a
keysym. <BR><B>MustQuit</B> is a function that returns true when the
system has received an SDL_QUIT event. Or in the case of the example
the ESC key was pressed. This is used in the main program for the
while program loop. As soon as this function returns true the program
will quit.</P>
<P><U>Processing Events</U></P>
<P>This is mainly done in the <B>ProcessEvent</B> function. Firstly
we call SDL_PollEvent to see if any events is available to be
processed and retrieve the event information if there is an event.</P>
<P>The SDL_Event structure is quite scary at first. But its really
not that bad. At the top level of the structure there is a <B>type
</B>variable. This is what the switch statement in the example checks
out. We only handle 3 event types in the example: SDL_QUIT,
SDL_KEYDOWN and SDL_KEYUP. From the descriptions its clear what they
mean. Now inside the SDL_Event structure there is a number of
sub-structures in there. And according to the type variable we look
at one of them specifically. For example for the KEYUP and KEYDOWN
events we will be looking at the <B>key</B> sub-structure. This
structure will contain the information about the event we need.
Likewise there is a sub-structure for every event. Some of them is
very small and contains nothing really. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Inside the <B>key</B> sub-structure
there is again some information that tells us if the key was pressed
or released. But we already know this. But there is also another
sub-structure called <B>keysym</B> of type SDL_keysym containing the
information of the specific key involved in the event. The only 2
entries of value for us is the <B>scancode</B> and the <B>sym</B>
values. With the <B>SDL_GetKeyName</B> function we can get a
meaningfull string for the key from the sym value. Sym values are of
the format SDLK_keyname. You can look them up in the documentation or
in the SDL_keysym.h include file. (/usr/include/SDL/ under linux)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Thats it for processing events. From
here on it is very simple to process other events like the mouse for
example. Or a joystick. There is also some intresting events like
timer events. But we will not look into them now.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Further improvement</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I've moved the SDLEventclass into
event.h and event.cpp to be used as a library for further
applications. I've also removed the example output code. The idea is
that we use this only as a base class for our application and then
overwrite the eventhandler function but still call the default one
for the QUIT event. I will continue to increase the functionality of
this class as the tutorials advance.</P>
<H1>Part 2 &ndash; Depth Buffer and Transformations</H1>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>previous code</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The <B>SDLVideoclass</B> used in
tutorial 1 is moved into video.h and video.cpp. To be used from there
as a library. We will also be using the <B>SDLEventclass</B> from
Part1 of this tutorial as the base class for our programs input
handling system. By dividing source code into multiple files it makes
it more controllable, easier to for multiple people to work on the
same project and increase compile speed as only the modified code
needs recompilation. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The example code is in <U>view.cpp</U>.
I called it view since this is mainly about viewing stuff.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>So
what is up?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Well rotation is not up... the only
thing around here that might go up is translation. anyways:</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The first steps you are familiar with.
Getting the video display up and runnning and getting the keyboard.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Next we setup the projection matrix.
Nothing new or funky here. And we select the MODELVIEW matrix for the
rest of the program.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Since this tutorial is about the
effects of the modelview matrix and not how todo geometry I've
written a small function called drawpiramid. It uses a QUAD and a
TRIANGLEFAN to draw the piramid. The code is fairly simple to
understand.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Depth buffer</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Ok so now we have a piramid. Which if
you haven't notice is actually a 3D object. It consists of a number
of polygons. (Triangles and Quads) that forms a sort of shell. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now when we look from a certain angle
at the piramid it we actually want to see only those that are in
front and not the back polygons. Else it would look fairly odd. Now
if we just draw things normally in in order we want there is a change
that we are lucky enough that the top polygons are drawn last and
thus ontop of the other, but the changes aint really in our favour :)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now the one way todo things is to sort
all polygons and draw them from in order. Farthest ones first and
closest ones last. Accept from giving us more than one headache we
really don't have time to do this sort of computing. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">So the way out is the depth buffer. We
enable the depth buffer using the <B>glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)</B>
function. For every pixel opengl writes in the depth buffer the
distance the pixel was from the camera. Then we it wants to write
another pixel on the same location on the screen it first checks if
the previous pixel is not already infront of this one. This might
seem like a even slower process, and if you had todo this with your
cpu in system memory it would be VERY VERY slow. But this process is
completely implemented with dedicated hardware on your graphics cards
hardware running in parallel with a million other things. The effect
is that this runs almost without any speed penalty. Nice hey!</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now we can do many funky things with
this depth buffer. But for now we will simply enable it and trust
that the default behaviour is acceptable. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Last note on Depth Buffer: We need to
clear the depth buffer also each time. So I've added
<B>GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</B> to <B>glClear</B>. Thus clearing the
visible color screen and the depth buffer at the same time. Most
hardware will probably do both in parallel resulting in no speed
penalty.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Translation</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">We start with
the most simple transform. Translating, ie. moving the object around.
In 3D space we can move the object along any of the x,y and z axis. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">The function
used is <B>glTranslatef(x,y,z)</B>. It alters the current matrix to
add the given translation.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">You can have a
number of <B>glTranslate</B> calls after each other and they will all
add up.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">In the example
the keys u and i translate along the x axis.<BR>And keys j and k
translate along the y axis.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Scaling</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">Scaling is also
fairly straight forward. We can stretch or compress the object in any
of the 3 axis.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">The function
used is <B>glScalef(x,y,z)</B>. It also alters the current matrix to
add the scaling.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the example we only scale the y
axis. Making the piramid higher or lower.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The keys a and s scales the piramid in
the example.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Rotation</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now here is were things can get crazy.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Ok we have a function <B>glRotatef</B>
which rotates the object around a given axis. The crazy thing is that
we can give it absolutely any axis. You are not limited to the x,y
and z axis.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">But to make things simpler in the
example we limit ourselves to the x,y and z axis. So we have 3
rotational values. And the order in which we do them makes a
difference in the behaviour of the rotations and also the final
result of the rotations.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Ok now try really hard to use your
imagination! <BR>Imagine yourself sitting in a F-14. (or whatever you
prefer) You have 3 axis. <BR>The x axis runs throught you from left
to right. (throught your shoulders)<BR>The y axis runs from top to
buttom. (through your head and out at the bottom of your chair)<BR>The
z axis runs from behind to infront. (The z axis point the direction
your flying)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now if you pull back on you control
stick, your plane starts pulling up its nose. Thus rotation around
the x axis. Got it? Hope so!<BR>Now the other axis have not changed
relative to you. The z axis still points the way your going but now a
bit more up into the sky. And the y axis is more backwards but is
still the upwards axis according to you.<BR>Next you tell the tail
flap to go slightly left or right. Your plane now starts to swing.
Thus rotation around the y axis. And yet after this the z axis still
points were you are going.<BR>Lastly you push the control stick left
banking the plane. This rotates you around the z axis. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now if we rotate in the order x,y,z we
can think of it as tilt,swing and roll. Or something like that.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now stand up. (Or if you have strong
imagination, imagine yourself standing up)<BR>Firstly you can turn
around. This is rotating around the y axis.<BR>Next you can bend over
or backwards. (looking up or down) This is rotating around your x
axis.<BR>And then if you turn your head sideways you rotate around
the z axis.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">So rotating in the order y,x,z would
be more suited for the view of a character running around in your
favourite dungeon.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the example I've implemented the
plane type rotation for the piramid. The arrow keys are for tilt and
roll and the keys z and x control the swing.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Final word on transformation</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Remember the order in which these
things happen is crucial. I do translating first then rotating then
scaling.<BR>Feel free to change the order of these things and see
what happens. The RedBook (version 1.1 already) has good
illustrations of this. I find that many times the only way to figure
this out is experimental</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Lastly you might notice that we start
with the identity matrix each frame and work from there. The reason
for this is that if we just add the latest changes we each time make
a very small error in calculation and eventually end up with
completely the wrong answer. Plus there is no other way to control
the order of the transformations.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I use the <B>SDL_GetTicks</B> command
to calculate the amount of time passed since the last modification.
Scaling the value changes with this. The result is that the
transformation speeds will be the same regardless of the framerate. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Finishing
up</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I hope this tutorial tough you
something worth while. And thay maybe you have a better understanding
of transformations. In the next tutorial I will have the new code
also in classes. And then we will apply some lighting to the scene.</P>
