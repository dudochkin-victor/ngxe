<P>Hi there! 
</P>
<P>In this tutorial we will start by setting up a basic class we can
use to create a opengl window and to also have basic interaction with
the keyboard. I will not be using the mouse for now.</P>
<P>You can start by firing up your favorite editor. The idea is that
you actually also write your own code and not simply use my code. My
code is simply an example. 
</P>
<P>But I believe the best way to learn to program is by reading code
and writing code. Thus I will try to keep my example code fairly
documented and self-explanatory. The idea is that you read the code
and this tutorial file at the same time. They form a unit together
trying to bring a message across.</P>
<P>For those that are already familiar with this part of opengl you
might simply want to scan through this tutorial. Enjoy!</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>NB</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I am not a pro at OpenGL. I may get things wrong. Do not blame me
for any problems you experience due to these tutorials. I welcome all
additional and corrections. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Here
we go!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok, so we've included opengl. And setup a makefile. And it
compiles and links. Great. What now?</P>
<P>Firstly we need to initialize SDL. Why SDL? because its easy and
its portable. enough said. <BR>We simply call
<B>SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)</B> to initialize SDL.<BR>It starts with
I/O, threading, file and video subsystems initialized. Off course
check for success. SDL also installs a parachute system to catch a
program crash and exit gracefully.</P>
<P>At the end of the program we call <B>SDL_Quit()</B> to shutdown
SDL.</P>
<P>In the very basic way we can just call
<B>SDL_SetVideoMode(640,480,16,SDL_OPENGL)</B> and we will get a
window to work with. We can change this to
<B>SDL_SetVideoMode(640,480,16,SDL_OPENGL|SDL_FULLSCREEN)</B> to make
the window full screen.</P>
<P>But we want something more flexible and useful than this. 
</P>
<P>I've created a class in the demo called <B>SDLVideoclass</B>. It
is a basic class with the functionality needed to control the video
screen setup for OpenGL. The idea is to get the graphics up and
running as smoothly as possible. SDL provide lots of functions to
make this easier.<BR>You only need to specify the width and height
you want to some extent. The default contructor makes ready for
640x480 windowed mode. You can specify your own width and height by
using the second contructor (as in the example) or using the <B>SetWidth</B>
and <B>SetHeight</B> functions.<BR>Enable full screen by using the
<B>Fullscreen</B> function. In windowed mode almost any resolution
will be fine. But in full screen mode only a few resolutions exist.
If you specify a resolution that does not exist SDL will try to
emulate it using the closest available resolution. But your graphics
will only appear in a window on the screen. Use the <B>FindMode</B>
function to find the closest mode available. It makes sense to run
FindMode after you've selected <B>Fullscreen</B>. When everything is
ready call <B>InitVideo</B>. You will hopefully end up with more or
less what you want. The Bits used per pixel is configured
automatically from the graphics hardware. Probably your X
setup.<BR>There is some more functions available in the class.
Checkout the code if your interested. To change something in the
video layout simply change the settings and call <B>InitVideo</B>
again.</P>
<P>The example uses a simple delay before quiting again.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>So
How about some Graphics?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>First some basics on opengl would be a good idea. OpenGl is like
state-machine in many ways. You set something and then it keeps that
setting until you change it. Things like colors, capabilities and
even vertices work in this way.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Clearing the screen</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">The first thing
we can do is clear the screen, as this is relatively simple. Its
basically a 2 step process:<BR>Step 1 is to select a color. We use
the <B>glClearColor(r,g,b,a)</B> Command. I've chosen a darkish blue
color in the example.<BR>Step 2 is to clear the screen. We use the
<B>glClear</B> command. I haven't told you this but there is more
than just one buffer in openGL. (I will tell you about the other
buffers and there uses later) The only buffer we use now is the Color
buffer. So the command is <B>glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)</B> . As
easy as that.<BR>Now remember I said opengl is a state machine! This
mean that you only have to specify the clear color once. Every call
to glClear there after will use the same color until you call
glClearColor with a different color.</P>
<P><U>OpenGl stuff</U></P>
<P>If you had this idea that we are going to start sticking models on
the screen now I'm sorry to disappoint. We're not even close to
anything on the screen. <BR>The process of putting things in 3D space
(such as your model) on the 2D screen involves lots of complex
mathematics. And we need to give some of these equations some basic
input values before we will be able to see anything on the screen.</P>
<P>I'm going to assume you have some imagination :) In our new (to be
created) 3d world there is basically to things. Firstly we have some
stuff there. Maybe a room? or a monster or a plane? This stuff is
called the geometry. Most of OpenGL is concerned with getting this
geometry stuff displayed on the screen as fast as possible. But the
second important thing is the spot we look from. We can casually
speak of the camera. What you eventually get on the screen is what
the camera sees. 
</P>
<P>3D graphics is really all build on top of matrix algebra. I now
you're thinking Neo, but sorry dude there is no rules to bend around
here. (like gravity) <BR>I'm not going to teach you matrix algebra or
mathematics. Educate yourself on that one. And I'm also not going to
assume you know very much about matrices. Well to start with every
matrix in OpenGL is a 4x4 grid of number. That means 16 numbers. If
you don't know this already your for now going to have to trust me.
You can multiply matrices with each other and do all sorts of funky
things with them. Now a point in 3d space is mostly 3 numbers x,y and
z. (Actually there is a fourth co-ordinate called w but we ignore
that for now)<BR>We call a point in 3D space a vertex. Now the really
wacky part is that we can multiple these vertices with matrices. By
having the correct numbers in the matrices we can then scale, move or
rotate these vertices.<BR>Things get even crazier when you realize
that the order in which you do the multiplications affects the
result.</P>
<P><U>Now lets get back to our camera:</U></P>
<P>Firstly we need to tell OpenGL where on the screen we want the
things that the camera can see. We create a viewport. Think of it as
a window on the screen that represents the LCD on the camera. The
command we use is <B>glViewport(x,y,w,h)</B>. x,y is the left-bottom
corner of the viewport. w and h specify the size in height and width.
note that the y axis is inverted customary to usual 2D graphics. y=0
is the bottom of your screen. while y=screen height is at the top of
your screen. I've inserted a glViewport command into the InitVideo
function of the SDLVideoclass that I've created. It tries to fill the
whole screen that SDL created with the viewport.</P>
<P>Next we would like to set how the lens of our camera works. The
matrix that specify the working of the camera lens is the PROJECTION
matrix. <BR>So we tell opengl we want to modify that matrix with
<B>glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION)</B>. As this is not a normal camera we
don't have the normal type of parameters such as focus and shutter
speed.<BR>Firstly we set the distances on which the camera works. If
things are too far away or too close then it will not be visible. And
then the Field-Of-View angle. A normal angle is about 45 degrees.
setting the angle to about 10 degrees gives a zoomed in view. While a
angle in the range of 180 degrees gives a fish-eye type view. The
last thing is the aspect ratio of the view. This depends on the
screen your using and also on the resolution.<BR>Normally the aspect
ratio can be computed as width/height of the viewport and is usually
in the range of 1.33<BR>To give opengl all of this information we use
the gluPerspective(fov,aspect,znear,nfar) command.<BR>(You might
notice the command start with <B>glu</B> ,this is because this
function is provided by the GLU library, an extension library to
opengl. This spares us the problem of computing the matrix
ourselves.)<BR>There is also the <B>glOrtho</B> and <B>gluOrtho2D</B>
commands to setup a orthographic projection. This is the type of view
a architect would you to draw a house. (Size of object is not
affected by distance)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Geometry transformation</U></P>
<P>The second most important matrix in the 3D maths world is the
matrix that transforms the geometry. This matrix is called the
MODELVIEW matrix. We will see lots more on this one. For now we load
the identity matrix into the modelview matrix.<BR>First tel opengl to
modify the Modelview matrix: <B>glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)</B><BR>Then
load the Identity matrix using: <B>glLoadIdentity()</B><BR>The
identity matrix is a very simple matrix that has no effect. Thus we
chose a setup where the modelview matrix will not modify the geometry
in any way.</P>
<P><B>How about some graphics now?</B></P>
<P>So now everything is ready, we can put the geometry on the screen.
For the example I've put a simple triangle on the screen. Lets look
at what is done.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>ColorMode</U></P>
<P>First is the <B>glShadeModel</B> command. This tells opengl how to
work with colors. I chose the GL_SMOOTH mode. This gives the triangle
nice interpolated colors.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Drawing the triangle</U></P>
<P>We start with <B>glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES)</B><BR>This tells opengl we
are about to draw some triangles. (only 1 as it turns out) Every
triangle has 3 vertices specifying it. Each set of 3 vertices
provided will be used by opengl to draw another triangle.</P>
<P>We specify a vertex with the <B>glVertex</B> function. You will
see there is 3 vertices specified in the example. Now what is that <B>3f</B>
behind the function. Or is it part of the function? Well because
opengl doesn't run on a overloading capable system like c++. It must
use different function if the parameters needs to be different. The
<B>3f</B> tells opengl that the vertex will be specified using 3
floating point numbers. There are many other variants to use. Check
out your reference to see this list.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Before each vertex there is a <B>glColor</B>
command. This way each point in the triangle has a different color
and opengl will interpolate color values for every point in between.
Because of the state machine nature of opengl we need to call <B>glColor</B>
before <B>glVertex</B>. We can also just call <B>glColor </B>once
before the 3 vertices, thus creating a triangle with a single color.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The last command is <B>glEnd</B>. This
tells opengl we are now finished drawing triangles. Its important to
remember this. <B>glBegin</B> and <B>glEnd</B> creates a sort of code
block in which geometry can be specified. Some opengl commands must
be inside and glBegin/glEnd block while others must be outside. Don't
worry all will become more and more clear as we proceed.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><U>Getting the stuff visible on the
screen.</U></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Opengl uses a double buffer system.
One buffer is visible to the user on the screen while we draw on the
back buffer in memory. Then when we are finished drawing a frame we
need to swap the buffers so that the stuff we've drawn now becomes
visible to the user. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">SDL provides a very simple command to
take care of this: <B>SDL_GL_SwapBuffers()<BR></B>It is very
important to call this after every frame. Else nothing will become
visible to the user.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Last
Words</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">So that wraps it up for the first
tutorial. This is all might seem very silly at the moment but this is
needed for just about every opengl application out there.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the next tutorial I will show you
how to interact with the keyboard using SDL and then also some more
things about drawing stuff on the screen.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Actually I still need to write a
proper tutorial part on drawing primitives! This will maybe be
available in a newer release.
