<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Tutorial 10</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Quote for today:</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">That's the thing about people
who think they hate computers. What they <BR>really hate is lousy
programmers.<BR>-- Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle in &quot;Oath of
Fealty&quot;</FONT></P>
<P>Modern hardware have this nice thing they call <B>shaders</B>. And
since this is already tutorial 10 I thought it might be a nice idea
start a little bit on shaders.</P>
<P>In tut 10 we have:<BR>Part 1 &ndash; Cg shaders intro<BR>Part 2 &ndash;
Simple model format with Blender<BR>Part 3 &ndash; Saving a screen
shot</P>
<H1>Part 1 &ndash; vertex shader intro using Cg</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Cg</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Cg (C 4 graphics) is a compiler made by Nvidia. It's both cross
API (OpenGL and DX) and runs on Windows and Linux. And it makes the
creation of shaders 10 times easier. 
</P>
<P>So no we don't have to learn the opengl shader language or the DX
shader language. Great hey.</P>
<P>Once again these tutorials do not aim to replace any official
documentation. I used that (and a bit of my mind) to write this. So
let the Cg documentation form the basis for knowledge.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>vertex
shader</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>There is 2 kinds of shaders. Vertex shaders and fragment shaders
(sometimes called pixel shaders). We are only going to look at Vertex
shaders for now.</P>
<P>Before the days of vertex shaders there was some dedicated
hardware inside the graphics card to process incoming vertex
information. It basically put the coordinates through some matrix
transformations to in the end get a location on the screen and a
z-coordinate for the Depth-buffer, among some other things.</P>
<P>Well now we have some programmable hardware in there :) Which
means we can write little program to do these transformations. The
advantage is that we can make some really great effects and also move
some processing from the cpu to the graphics card so that the cpu can
be used for other things.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Documentation</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>If you've installed Cg you will have in there somewhere a file
called <B>Cg_Toolkit.pdf</B>. Most of the information you need is in
this file. A second document that might come in handy is the <B>GL
Shader Language Specification</B>. And maybe you might look at the
<B>OpenGL 2.0 specs</B>?</P>
<P>Quick road map to Cg_Toolkit PDF file:<BR>1. Read &ldquo;<U>Cg's
Programming Model for GPU's</U>&rdquo; under &ldquo;<U>Introduction
to Cg</U>&rdquo;!<BR>2. Take a look at &ldquo;<U>Program Inputs and
Outputs</U>&rdquo; although this might just be confusing the first
time.<BR>3. The section &ldquo;<U>Statements and Operators</U>&rdquo;
are mostly like standard C but not completely. For starters scan
through this.<BR>4. The &ldquo;<U>Standard Library Functions</U>&rdquo;
is probably what you will look at mostly in the beginning.<BR>5. You
can read the section on &ldquo;Using Cg-Runtime Library&rdquo; but
you might first want to read my tutorials shorten version below.<BR>6.
The &ldquo;<U>Brief tutorial</U>&rdquo; is a nice thing to read to
get a general idea about things.<BR>7. The &ldquo;<U>BASIC Profile
Sample Shaders section</U>&rdquo; is a good place to start looking
for ideas and get perspective.<BR>8. In &ldquo;<U>Appendix B</U>&rdquo;
we will be looking at &ldquo;<U>OpenGL NV_vertex_program 1.0</U>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<U>OpenGL NV_texture_shader</U>&rdquo; at first. ()<BR>9.
&ldquo;<U>Appendix C - Nine Steps</U>&rdquo; will also be a good read
someday.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Quick
Intro to Cg Runtime</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Cg runtime is a library that enables you to load shaders from .cg
files at run time. Compile them for the current hardware available.
And also gives you a simple interface to specify some inputs to your
shader programs.</P>
<P>Go look in the example: <U>shader.cpp</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
in the <B>CGShader</B> name space code.</SPAN></P>
<P>Firstly you need a context to work with. Think of the context
simply as a handle to the graphics cards shader architecture.<BR>Create
a new context with <B>cgCreateContext()</B>.</P>
<P>Next we need profiles. We need one profile for the vertex shader
and one for the fragment shader. A profile is where Cg keeps
information about the current available hardware and how to &ldquo;compile&rdquo;
the shaders.<BR>Creat a new shader with c<B>gGLGetLatestProfile(shader)</B>
where shader is <B>CG_GL_VERTEX</B> or <B>CG_GL_FRAGMENT</B>.<BR>Optimize
the settings of a profile with <B>cgGLSetOptimalOptions(profile)</B></P>
<P>By default the fixed pipeline is enabled. To use the programmable
shader/fragment pipeline we simply need to enable the profile with
<B>cgGLEnableProfile(profile)</B>. (I've created some shorter
functions in the example)<BR>To switch back to the fixed pipeline we
need to disable the profile with <B>cgGLDisableProfile(profile)</B>.</P>
<P>Now look at <B>CGShaderclass</B> object in <U>shader.cpp</U>.</P>
<P>Now every shader is a program stored in a <B>CGprogram</B> object.
We can have many programs but at any moment in time only 1 vertex
program and 1 shader program can be active.</P>
<P>First we need to load the program from its source file
with:<BR><B>cgCreateProgramFromFile(CGcontext,programtype,filename,profile,entry,args)</B><BR>programtype
is either <B>CG_SOURCE</B> or <B>CG_OBJECT</B>. <BR>(<B>CG_OBJECT</B>
is when you pre-compiled the shader with <B>cgc</B> to object
code.)<BR>Entry is the main function in the code which is the main
function of the shader, default to <B>main</B>.<BR>args is list of
strings passed to the compiler as arguments.</P>
<P>Before a program can be binded/Activated it need to be
prepared/Loaded with:<BR><B>cgGLLoadProgram(program)</B></P>
<P>To activate a specific shader program we simply call
<B>cgGLBindProgram(program)</B>.<BR>(I've created a function called
<B>Bind</B> for <B>CGShaderclass</B>)</P>
<P>Some input parameters are known as uniform parameters. (Like the
time parameter in the example)<BR>The values of these parameters are
stored in special registers which the shader program can access while
running. <BR>To work with these uniform parameters we must first get
a handle to the parameter using
<B>cgGetNamedParameter(program,&rdquo;name&rdquo;)</B><BR>(See the
<B>Load</B> function of <B>WaveShaderclass</B>.)<BR>Now we can set
values to these parameters using <B>cgGLSet*</B> commands.<BR>(See
<B>UpdateState</B> of <B>WaveShaderclass</B>)<BR>In Cg_Toolkit.pdf
checkout the section &ldquo;<B>OpenGL Cg Runtime</B>&rdquo; under
&ldquo;<B>Using Cg-Runtime Library</B>&rdquo; for information on
Parameters and all the available functions for setting parameters.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Example</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The example shader code is in <U>wave.cg</U>.
And gets loaded and used by <U>shader.cpp</U>.<BR>This example is
very very very simple! 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I only made a vertex shader. (No
fragment shader today, sorry)</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The code is pretty straight forward.
It construct a wave moving out from the centre location.<BR>It would
be easy to extend the program so that we can move the center
location.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The next logical thing to add to the
shader is to enable normal computation and also reflection
computation.<BR>A good example of these things is in Cg_Toolkit.pdf
under &ldquo;<U>Basic Profile Sample Shaders</U>&rdquo; the one
called &ldquo;<U>Sine Wave Demo</U>&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>All
for now</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Thats all for shaders for today.<BR>One of the first things we
will use shaders for is in model drawing. <BR>(Take a look at &ldquo;Matrix
Palette Skinning&rdquo; if your interested)<BR><BR>Shaders makes many
wonderful things possible, and one can understand why all the fuzz is
around.</P>
<P>But a shader alone doesn't make a graphics engine...</P>
<H1>Part 2 &ndash; Blender</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>learning
blender</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Well first question would possibly be: why not 3d studio? Well
actually I have this plan in the back of my head to get these
tutorials to work with both 3dsmax and blender. But currently I go
for only blender. Blender is fully featured. And it's free! A
complete 3D editing program for free. I think thats nice.</P>
<P>Blender has a weird interface that might seem a bit scary at
first. I've included one tutorial in starting to use blender with
this tutorial.</P>
<P>Don't worry you will be able to get through these tutorials with
almost no knowledge of blender. :)<BR>But it might help. Blender is
not that evil. And there is huge amounts of stuff on the net for
blender.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Python
Scripts</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The nice thing about blender is we can write small python scripts
to run inside blender. You can do all sorts of funky things. But all
we're going to do is use this little python script to output the 3D
data from blender to another file we can the read with our C program.
Because reading .blend files is crazy and not encourages.</P>
<P>Ok so now you stare this new python beast in the eyes?<BR>Well
python is a very great scripting language. There exist many good
reasons to learn python, such as &ldquo;it rocks&rdquo; ;)<BR>I know
just enough python to find my way around the references and get some
basic programming done.<BR>Python is not difficult.</P>
<P>But once again you will be able to get through these tutorials
with very little to no python knowledge. So I'm not going to teach
you python. There's enough tutorials out there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>A
simple format</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Ok think back about the quake model we loaded....</P>
<P>That model had all the data nicely packed. Plus it also had these
structures that told us how to draw the model using triangle-strips
and triangle-fans. Now drawing a surface using a triangle-strip is a
lot faster than using separate triangles. The longer the strip/fan
the more the increase in speed. If you're still wondering why:
Drawing with strips/fans needs less vertex information for the same
amount of triangles, resulting in less data-transfer needed, less
memory access, less strain on AGP. And most graphics cards are
optimized to for drawing strips/fans. Thus things are FASTER :D</P>
<P>But blender doesn't give things this way. Blender just give what
we might call &ldquo;raw&rdquo; 3D data. Unorganized and in a form
that might mostly seem chaotic maybe even.</P>
<P>So our strategy looks like follows:<BR>1. Use a simple python
script to export raw 3D data into simple file format<BR>2. Load
simple file format with out c++ program.<BR>3. Calculate more
optimized data structures (like striping)<BR>4. Write out to proper
packed model file format<BR>5. Use proper packed model file format in
application</P>
<P>OK today we will start with an introduction on steps 1 &amp; 2.</P>
<P>Step 3 is a HUGE step and will take much of out time in the
future. Triangle stripping is a difficult subject. While we also want
to look into things like model simplification. 
</P>
<P>For some time we will be working with just the idea that these
things in blender will become models. Like aliens, or weapons or
spaceships ect.<BR>But keep in your mind that we can also create
terrain or maps in blender. Which will require different file formats
and completely different rendering techniques.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
simple file format</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Goto the example in <U>simple.cpp</U>. And look near the top of
the program. There you will find a number of structures defines with
names starting with S. These are the structures for the simple file
format.</P>
<P>The first thing in the file is the header.(<B>SHeader</B>) The
header tells us that this is the simple file format. And also gives a
version number. We will change the version number as we go along in
these tuts.<BR>The header might also contain pointers to some global
data. <BR><B>Note</B>: When I talk about a pointer in the file it is
simply a integer number which is the offset in the file where the
data can be found.<BR>Currently the header only tells us the number
of objects in the file.</P>
<P>Following the header we have a directory listing for the objects.
For each object there is a type flag and a pointer. (<B>SObjIndex</B>)</P>
<P>When we go to the position in the file where the object is saved
we find the object data. Depending on the type of object we will find
different data.<BR>At the beginning of the objects data there is
another index. The index tells us what types of data there is and
where the data is saved in the file. (<B>SIndex</B>)</P>
<P>The Types of data:<BR><B>Global object data</B> &ndash; like where
the object is and so forth. (<B>SObjInfo</B>)<BR><B>Vertex data</B> &ndash;
Just a long list of vertices and there data (a header of <B>SStart</B>
and then lots of <B>SVertex</B>) <BR><B>Faces</B> &ndash; The faces
between the vertices and there data (a header of <B>SStart</B> and
then lots of <B>SFace</B>)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
script</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The script is in <U>simpleexport.py</U>.<BR>To run the script from
Blender you can save it in the blender scripts directory. Or:<BR>1.
Open blender.<BR>2. Chane a window to &ldquo;Text Editor&rdquo;<BR>3.
Open the file &ldquo;simpleexport.py&rdquo;<BR>4. Run the Script
(Ctrl+P)<BR>5. The script will ask you for a filename to which to
save the data.<BR>6. If all went well there will be a new file in the
simple object format.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>How
does the script work?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>This is not a tutorial in python or Blender. So I will only give
you the vague information.<BR>To write Blender python scripts I
strongly advise you to download the Blender Python documentation.</P>
<P>The script starts at <B>savefile</B>. Which start by writing the
header and then one by one save the objects. For every object it
saves an entry in the index data and then calls <B>saveobject</B>.</P>
<P>The function <B>saveobject</B> saves the data for a specific
object. For every group of data an entry in the index is made and
then a specific function is called to save the data.</P>
<P><B>saveobjectinfo</B> saves the global data for the object. Like
where the object is and so forth.</P>
<P><B>savefaces</B> saves the data for all the faces in the object.</P>
<P><B>savevertices</B> saves the data for all the vertices in the
object.</P>
<P><B>saveheader</B> is a simple function used by savefile to save
the header.</P>
<P>Special care must be taken in the formatting of the data so that
out c++ program can easily read the data again. The <B>struct.pack</B>
function has some funny quirks to work around. But this is a mile
better than saving in some kind of a text format. <BR>Although the
advantage of a text format is that you can read the data with your
eyes it makes loading the format much harder and you quickly lose the
ability to read the data once there is more than 100 vertices and 50
faces. (What do you mean you can't visualize 90 points in 3D space
from coordinates on paper?!?)</P>
<P>Much more will be added to this script later on.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Loading
the simple format in C++</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Look in <U>simple.cpp</U>. There is an object <B>SObjectclass</B>.
</P>
<P>Inside the object there is data structures for some global
information and also for Vertices and Faces.</P>
<P>Then there is the <B>SimpleObjectclass</B>. Which contains a
number of objects. A whole file is loaded into this class and it
spawns one <B>SObjectclass</B> for every object there is.</P>
<P>There is a number of Load functions. I've inserted some comments
into the code to make things more clear.<BR>What basically happens is
simply a move of the data from the file to the memory.</P>
<P>Then there is a simple draw routine. The draw routine is painfully
slow but it works and is good enough to show that we did indeed get
the same data as was in blender originally.</P>
<P>The example simply loads the file and display all the objects
inside the file then quit after a short delay.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Further
development</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Next we will build on top of the work done here to also export
material and texturing information. And some more information on the
lights in blender. Objects without texturing is no good for nothing
accept wireframe drawing.</P>
<P>If you are unfamiliar with blender it might be a good idea to play
a bit with this nifty program. Or if you are a 3d Studio Max user
then you might want to find out how to export from 3d studio... ?</P>
<H1>Part 3 &ndash; Taking a screen shot</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>As
easy as that!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Take a look at the example in <U>shot.cpp</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
and mainly at the <B>saveimage</B> function.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">Saving a screen shot is easy. All we
need to do is get the image data from the frame buffer and save it in
a file. SDL makes this easier by giving as a <B>SDL_SaveBMP</B>
function.</P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">So we start by creating a
<B>SDL_Surface</B> the same size as the screen using
<B>SDL_CreateRGBSurface</B>.<BR>I've used a 24-bit RGB pixel format
but some other things will also work. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">To read data from the frame buffer
is very easy with the <B>glReadPixels</B> command. The format
is:<BR><B>glReadPixels(x,y,width,height,format,type,pixels)</B></P>
<P>But now we once again run into the problem that the y axis of the
GL frame buffer is inverted compared to SDL. The easy way out is to
ignore the problem and simply flip the image afterwards using some
other image program. (Linux do have some nice utilities out there)</P>
<P>But thats not really satisfying.<BR>The one solution is to render
the image upside down. This is easily achieved by rotating the camera
matrix before rendering the scene. But this might result in rendering
the scene twice if we still want to display it on the screen.<BR>So
the simple solution that I presented is to flip the image inside the
SDL_Surface pixel buffer. The down-side is that this requires some
extra processing power. Which could be considered a problem if the
screen is very BIG. <BR>A very nice and proper solution would be to
somehow save the BMP file directly from the inverted image data. But
that would require another image library, or some modification to
SDL.</P>
<P>All that remains is to call <B>SDL_SaveBMP</B> with a filename.
And there you have a screen shot.</P>
<P>O yes remember that you must take the screen shot before you call
SDL_GL_Swapbuffers else you will get the wrong data. Or rather not
the last rendered frame ;)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>End
of this tut</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Thats all folks!</P>
<P>Hope you still enjoy openGL! I am :)
