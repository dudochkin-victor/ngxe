Framewave Version FW_1.3.1
=================================================

OVERVIEW :

Framewave(TM) is a collection of low-level software routines for x86 processors.
Framewave (FW) is designed to aid and accelerate application development, debugging,
and optimization. Framewave function capabilities extend from simple arithmetic
operations to rich, complex domain specific tasks, such as image, video, and
signal processing.
